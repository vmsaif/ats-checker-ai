Hiring Manager
Radical AI 
Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Artificial Intelligence Engineer Internship at Radical AI. As a recent Computer Science graduate with a passion for creating impactful AI solutions, I am particularly drawn to Radical AI's mission of democratizing AI technology for social good. My skills and experience in Python, LangChain, and machine learning align well with the requirements for this role, and I am eager to contribute to your team's efforts in leveraging AI for positive change. 

During my recent project, ATS Pass AI, I spearheaded the development of an AI-powered resume optimization tool using Python, CrewAI, LangChain, and Gemini. This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of machine learning, natural language processing, and data analysis â€“ all of which are directly relevant to this internship.  My experience with OpenAI API integrations will be particularly valuable in contributing to Radical AI's work with cutting-edge AI technologies.  

Beyond my technical skills, I am a strong advocate for ethical AI development.  I am particularly interested in Radical AI's commitment to ensuring equitable and responsible use of AI, aligning with my own values and career aspirations. My experience as a Programming Mentor, where I taught Python and Java, has honed my communication and collaboration skills, enabling me to thrive in team-oriented environments. 

I am confident that my technical abilities, combined with my dedication to ethical AI practices, make me a strong candidate for the Artificial Intelligence Engineer Internship. I have attached my resume for your review and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to Radical AI's important work. 

Sincerely,
Saif Mahmud
