Explanation for Not Choosing Other Experiences (One by one):

1. Recursive Ray Tracing: While relevant to computer graphics and potentially showcasing mathematical skills, it lacks direct alignment with AI, machine learning, or the specific technologies mentioned in the job description.

2. Bank Account System: This project demonstrates object-oriented programming skills in Java but doesn't showcase AI or machine learning concepts relevant to the AI Engineer role.

3. Hosting a Resume on GitHub Pages: Although it highlights technical writing and version control skills, this project doesn't demonstrate expertise in AI or related technologies.

4. ELF Binary Analysis: This experience focuses on C programming, debugging, and system analysis, which are valuable skills but not directly related to the AI-focused requirements of the job description.

5. OpenGL Sphere Lighting:  Similar to "Recursive Ray Tracing," this project focuses on computer graphics and doesn't align with the core AI and machine learning aspects of the job description.

6. Connect 4 Game: While this project involves AI decision-making, it might be perceived as a simpler application of AI compared to the more sophisticated AI models and technologies sought by Radical AI.

7. TCP Chat Application: This project demonstrates network programming and multithreading skills in Java, but it doesn't align with the AI or machine learning requirements outlined in the job description.
