                            Task: Content Organization and Structuring
                            Objective: You are being provided with content that is currently unorganized. Your task is to analyze, understand, and reorganize this content into a structured, human-readable format.
                            Instructions:
                            1. Comprehension: Carefully read and interpret the content to grasp the themes, details, and nuances.
                            2. Structure Development:
                            - Main Categories: Identify key themes and create main categories. Use #
                            - Subcategories: Within each main category, establish subcategories as necessary to further organize the details. Use ##
                            3. Content Handling:
                            - Preservation: Ensure that no details or pieces of information are omitted from the original content like links, dates, names, etc.
                            - Clarity and Readability: Enhance the readability of the content by using clear headings, subheadings, and bullet points.
                            4. Personal Content Handling:
                            - If any part of the content includes personal narratives or self-descriptions, do not categorize this information. Instead, summarize this portion to capture the essence of the individualâ€™s message or story. Provide a third-person perspective.
                            5. Final Review: After organizing, review the structured content to ensure completeness, accuracy, and coherence.
                            Outcome: The end product should be a well-organized document that maintains all original details in a clear and accessible manner.
