        - Carefully determine if a skill is technical (related to tools, technologies) or soft (related to personality, work style). 
    4.  **Projects:** For each project, extract the following fields: "Project Title", "Timeline" (include Start Month Year - End Month Year, "Technologies", "Link", "Key achievements".

    6.  **Education:** Extract these fields: "Degree", "Major", "University", "Location" (City, State), "Graduation Date", "GPA". 
    7.  **Additional:** Include any other relevant sections, like "References," based on the input data.

    **Important:** 
       - You MUST include ALL data from the input. Do NOT leave out any information. If a field is missing, represent it as an empty string ("").
       - Do NOT fabricate, invent, or add ANY information that is not explicitly stated in the input data.
       - Do not infer, assume, or create any details not directly present in the input.

ats_friendly_keywords_into_experiences:
  description: >
    This task helps you create compelling resume bullet points by adding important
    keywords from a job description to descriptions of your work experiences.
    The goal is to make these descriptions stand out to Applicant Tracking
    Systems (ATS), while also being easy to read and understand.

    guidelines:
      - **Relevance:** Only use keywords that truly fit with the experience you're
        describing.
      - **Natural Language:** Keywords should fit smoothly into the sentences. Don't
        just list keywords or force them in where they don't belong.
      - **Conciseness and Clarity:** Use strong action verbs and remove unnecessary
        words. Focus on making a big impact with few words. Summarize each
        experience in 1-2 short, powerful sentences, just like you would on a resume.
      - **Context Matters:** Think about the overall story of each experience. Pick
        keywords that accurately show the skills you used and what you were
        responsible for.
      - **Avoid Keyword Overload:** Using too many keywords can actually hurt your
        chances. Aim for a balanced and impactful description without repeating
        keywords too much.
