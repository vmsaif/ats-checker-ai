    Extract the personal information of the applicant from the provided data. Then convert the extracted data into the LaTeX format. If you don't find any information at all, the output should be empty.

    In the output, 
    - The first line contains the name. Use the command \namesection{First Name and Middle Name if available}{Last Name}.
    - Then the next line will contain the URLs. Use the command \urlstyle{same} to keep the URLs in the same style as the text. The line will contain urls up to 2. then \\ to linebreak. Use \href for the URLs. The argument of \href should be the URL and the text should be the URL without the protocol.
    - The third line will contain the email, phone number, and location. Use the command \href for the email. The argument of \href should be the email and the text should be the email. The phone number should be in the format of 204 955 5064. The location should be in the format of a City or province.
    - Pipeline '|' should be used to separate the data and must not be the last character of the output.
    - The output should be raw latex code and should not be in a code block.

    Example:
    \namesection{Saif}{Mahmud}
    {
      \urlstyle{same}\href{https://saifmahmud.dev}{saifmahmud.dev} | \href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/vmsaif/}{linkedin.com/in/vmsaif}\\

concise_jd_task:
  description: >
    Summarize the provided job description into a concise format that highlights the essential responsibilities and requirements of the role. This summary should efficiently encapsulate the key elements of the job to aid in determining which sections of an applicant's profile (such as Education, Volunteer Work, Awards and Recognitions, References, Personal Traits and Interests, Miscellaneous) are most relevant and should be included in a resume. The summary should serve as a reference for another agent responsible for selecting the appropriate resume sections based on the job alignment.

    The concise summary should be both informative and succinct, providing clear guidance without overwhelming detail. No need to hint which sections to select, just summarize the job description with the next agent's task in mind.
  expected_output: >
    A concise summary of the job description, no more than 2000 characters, effectively outlining the main responsibilities and essential qualifications required for the role. This summary should provide enough information to facilitate effective decision-making regarding the inclusion of relevant sections in the applicant's resume.

    - Each volunteer entry should be structured as follows:
      - Use `\subsection{}` for organization names less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\smallSubSection{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization name entries.
      - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Timeline`. Use `\subTitle{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.
      - Use the `vitemize` environment to list the responsibilities and achievements of the volunteer role.
    - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.
    - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
      - `%` to `\%`
      - `$` to `\$`
      - `&` to `\&`
      - `#` to `\#`
      - `_` to `\_`

    Example: First Decide if to use `\subsection{}` or `\smallSubSection{}` based on the length of the organization name for all entries. The command should be the same for all entries.

    \section{VOLUNTEER}
      \subsection{.dev Programming Club} or swap with \smallSubSection{.dev Programming Club}
