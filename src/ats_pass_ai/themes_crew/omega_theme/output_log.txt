2024-06-02 23:42:06: task=Convert the volunteer work information of the applicant from the provided data into the LaTeX format, focusing on organization, clarity, and adherence to LaTeX syntax conventions.
**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization names up to 22 characters.
   - For names longer than 22 characters, use `\subHeading{}` to ensure the name fits without breaking LaTeX formatting.
   - If the organization name is too long for one line, split the name at an appropriate point and continue on the next line with `\subHeading{}`.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) and separate them with `\newline` to clearly delineate individual tasks or contributions.

5. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

6. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Example Outputs**:
**Example 1 - Short Organization Name**:
\section{VOLUNTEER} \subsection{.dev Programming Club} \subHeading{Active Member | University of Manitoba Students Union (UMSU) | 2019-2023} - Engaged with the latest software development technologies and tools. \newline - Collaborated on team projects focused on Python and Cloud Technologies. \sectionsep
**Example 2 - Long Organization Name**:
\section{VOLUNTEER} \subHeading{Student Union of University of Manitoba} % Using \subHeading{} due to length \subHeading{Active Member | 2019-2023} - Engaged with the latest software development technologies and tools. \newline - Collaborated on team projects focused on Python and Cloud Technologies. \sectionsep
**Spacing Between Sections**: - Use `\skillsVSpace` to add vertical spacing before starting a new `\section{}` if another section follows the volunteer section.
**Conditions**: - Only generate the `\section{VOLUNTEER}` if there is at least one volunteer entry. If no entries are provided, leave the output blank without placeholder LaTeX comments.

2024-06-02 23:45:23: task=Convert the volunteer work information of the applicant from the provided data into the LaTeX format, focusing on organization, clarity, and adherence to LaTeX syntax conventions.
**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization names up to 22 characters.
   - For names longer than 22 characters, use `\subHeading{}` to ensure the name fits without breaking LaTeX formatting.
   - If the organization name is too long for one line, split the name at an appropriate point and continue on the next line with `\subHeading{}`.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) and separate them with `\newline` to clearly delineate individual tasks or contributions.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\sectionsep` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   

5. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

6. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Example Outputs**:
**Example 1 - Short Organization Name**:
\section{VOLUNTEER} \subsection{.dev Programming Club} \subHeading{Active Member | University of Manitoba Students Union (UMSU) | 2019-2023} - Engaged with the latest software development technologies and tools. \newline - Collaborated on team projects focused on Python and Cloud Technologies. \sectionsep

**Spacing Between Sections**: - Use `\skillsVSpace` to add vertical spacing before starting a new `\section{}` if another section follows the volunteer section.
**Conditions**: - Only generate the `\section{VOLUNTEER}` if there is at least one volunteer entry. If no entries are provided, leave the output blank without placeholder LaTeX comments.

2024-06-02 23:53:03: task=Convert the volunteer work information of the applicant from the provided data into the LaTeX format, focusing on organization, clarity, and adherence to LaTeX syntax conventions.
**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization names up to 20 characters.
   - For organization names longer than 20 characters, use `\subHeading{}` instead of '\subsection{}'. This is to maintain consistent formatting and avoid layout issues.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) and separate them with `\newline` to clearly delineate individual tasks or contributions.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\sectionsep` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Example Outputs**:
**Example 1 - Short Organization Name**:
\section{VOLUNTEER} \subsection{.dev Programming Club} \subHeading{Active Member | University of Manitoba Students Union (UMSU) | 2019-2023} - Engaged with the latest software development technologies and tools. \newline - Collaborated on team projects focused on Python and Cloud Technologies. \sectionsep

**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization names less than 20 characters. Otherwise, use `\subHeading{}` to maintain consistent formatting and avoid layout issues.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\skillsVSpace \skillsVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. Otherwise, use `\subHeading{}` to maintain consistent formatting and avoid layout issues.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Example Outputs**:
**Example 1 - Short Organization Name**:

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\subHeading{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\subHeading{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\subHeading{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Example Outputs**:
**Example 1 - Short Organization Name**:
\section{VOLUNTEER} \subsection{.dev Programming Club} \subHeading{Active Member | University of Manitoba Students Union (UMSU) | 2019-2023} - Engaged with the latest software development technologies and tools. \\ - Collaborated on team projects focused on Python and Cloud Technologies.  \entryVSpace \sectionsep

**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\subHeading{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\subHeading{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`

2024-06-04 09:20:51: task=Convert the volunteer work information of the applicant from the provided data into the LaTeX format, focusing on organization, clarity, and adherence to LaTeX syntax conventions.
**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\subHeading{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\subHeading{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\subHeading{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\subHeading{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\subHeading{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:

   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\smallSubSection{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subTitle{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) and end with `\\` for line breaks, exepct the last one. 

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\newEntryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Example Outputs**:
**Example 1**: First Decide if to use `\subsection{}` or `\smallSubSection{}` based on the length of the organization name for all entries. The command should be same for all entries.

2024-06-06 23:05:58: task=Convert the volunteer work information of the applicant from the provided data into the LaTeX format, focusing on organization, clarity, and adherence to LaTeX syntax conventions.
**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command. 

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\smallSubSection{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Timeline`. Use `\subTitle{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) and end with `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\newEntryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Example Outputs**:
**Example 1**: First Decide if to use `\subsection{}` or `\smallSubSection{}` based on the length of the organization name for all entries. The command should be same for all entries.

In your output, follow these guidelines:
- The first line should contain the section name "VOLUNTEER". Use the command `\section{VOLUNTEER}`. - Each volunteer entry should be structured as follows:
  - Use `\subsection{}` for organization names less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\smallSubSection{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.
  - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Timeline`. Use `\subTitle{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.
  - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) and end with `\\` for line breaks.
  - Use `\newEntryVSpace` to separate each volunteer entry and maintain a consistent structure.
- Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections. - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
  - `%` to `\%`
  - `$` to `\$`
  - `&` to `\&`
  - `#` to `\#`
