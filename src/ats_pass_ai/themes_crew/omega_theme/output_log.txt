Artificial Intelligence Engineer

About Radical AI:

Radical AI Principles
We recognize that power is distributed unevenly, and People of Color, Black, Indigenous, Women, Queer, Trans, Gender Non-Conforming, Poor, Dis-abled, and other communities are pushed to the margins. We commit to resisting these interlocking systems of oppression, including Racism, Coloniality, Casteism, Heteropatriarchy, Capitalism, and Ableism. We commit to striving toward collective liberation.1
We center radical work by communities at the margins.
We recognize that all technologies rearrange power.
We are critical of how AI shifts power. In particular, we recognize AI is frequently extractive, exploitative, surveilling, controlling, prescriptive, and reductionist. We recognize AI frequently prevents consent, deliberation, investigation, intervention, resistance, and agency.
We recognize the privilege of being adjacent to institutions creating technologies. We use this privilege to step up to expose oppressive technologies and to center those harmed, and to step back, ceding power, listening, and co-conspiring when those voices speak.
We value dreaming up and building human/AI systems that put power in the hands of the people. We recognize this is vulnerable and important work.
We recognize that reforming harmful AI can reduce harm to some while legitimizing (“ethics-washing”) systems still harming others2. Only by understanding the root of the harm and centering those most impacted can we make these complex tactical decisions, deciding when to minimize harm done by AI and when to call for its abolition3. We recognize that no one has a ‘view from nowhere’4. We practice reflexivity, naming who we are, how who we are influences what we do, and whose perspectives are missing.

At the Radical AI for Social Good Lab, we’re dedicated to leveraging AI responsibly. Our core mission is to democratize AI technology, making it a catalyst for education, social mobility, and equitable progress across global communities.

About Radical AI:

Radical AI Principles
We recognize that power is distributed unevenly, and People of Color, Black, Indigenous, Women, Queer, Trans, Gender Non-Conforming, Poor, Dis-abled, and other communities are pushed to the margins. We commit to resisting these interlocking systems of oppression, including Racism, Coloniality, Casteism, Heteropatriarchy, Capitalism, and Ableism. We commit to striving toward collective liberation.1
We center radical work by communities at the margins.
We recognize that all technologies rearrange power.
We are critical of how AI shifts power. In particular, we recognize AI is frequently extractive, exploitative, surveilling, controlling, prescriptive, and reductionist. We recognize AI frequently prevents consent, deliberation, investigation, intervention, resistance, and agency.
We recognize the privilege of being adjacent to institutions creating technologies. We use this privilege to step up to expose oppressive technologies and to center those harmed, and to step back, ceding power, listening, and co-conspiring when those voices speak.
We value dreaming up and building human/AI systems that put power in the hands of the people. We recognize this is vulnerable and important work.
We recognize that reforming harmful AI can reduce harm to some while legitimizing (“ethics-washing”) systems still harming others2. Only by understanding the root of the harm and centering those most impacted can we make these complex tactical decisions, deciding when to minimize harm done by AI and when to call for its abolition3. We recognize that no one has a ‘view from nowhere’4. We practice reflexivity, naming who we are, how who we are influences what we do, and whose perspectives are missing.

At the Radical AI for Social Good Lab, we’re dedicated to leveraging AI responsibly. Our core mission is to democratize AI technology, making it a catalyst for education, social mobility, and equitable progress across global communities.

Artificial Intelligence Engineer

About Radical AI:

Radical AI Principles
We recognize that power is distributed unevenly, and People of Color, Black, Indigenous, Women, Queer, Trans, Gender Non-Conforming, Poor, Dis-abled, and other communities are pushed to the margins. We commit to resisting these interlocking systems of oppression, including Racism, Coloniality, Casteism, Heteropatriarchy, Capitalism, and Ableism. We commit to striving toward collective liberation.1
We center radical work by communities at the margins.
We recognize that all technologies rearrange power.
We are critical of how AI shifts power. In particular, we recognize AI is frequently extractive, exploitative, surveilling, controlling, prescriptive, and reductionist. We recognize AI frequently prevents consent, deliberation, investigation, intervention, resistance, and agency.
We recognize the privilege of being adjacent to institutions creating technologies. We use this privilege to step up to expose oppressive technologies and to center those harmed, and to step back, ceding power, listening, and co-conspiring when those voices speak.
We value dreaming up and building human/AI systems that put power in the hands of the people. We recognize this is vulnerable and important work.
We recognize that reforming harmful AI can reduce harm to some while legitimizing (“ethics-washing”) systems still harming others2. Only by understanding the root of the harm and centering those most impacted can we make these complex tactical decisions, deciding when to minimize harm done by AI and when to call for its abolition3. We recognize that no one has a ‘view from nowhere’4. We practice reflexivity, naming who we are, how who we are influences what we do, and whose perspectives are missing.

At the Radical AI for Social Good Lab, we’re dedicated to leveraging AI responsibly. Our core mission is to democratize AI technology, making it a catalyst for education, social mobility, and equitable progress across global communities.

We recognize that reforming harmful AI can reduce harm to some while legitimizing (“ethics-washing”) systems still harming others2. Only by understanding the root of the harm and centering those most impacted can we make these complex tactical decisions, deciding when to minimize harm done by AI and when to call for its abolition3. We recognize that no one has a ‘view from nowhere’4. We practice reflexivity, naming who we are, how who we are influences what we do, and whose perspectives are missing.

At the Radical AI for Social Good Lab, we’re dedicated to leveraging AI responsibly. Our core mission is to democratize AI technology, making it a catalyst for education, social mobility, and equitable progress across global communities.

About the job
Artificial Intelligence Engineer

About Radical AI:

Radical AI Principles
We recognize that power is distributed unevenly, and People of Color, Black, Indigenous, Women, Queer, Trans, Gender Non-Conforming, Poor, Dis-abled, and other communities are pushed to the margins. We commit to resisting these interlocking systems of oppression, including Racism, Coloniality, Casteism, Heteropatriarchy, Capitalism, and Ableism. We commit to striving toward collective liberation.1
We center radical work by communities at the margins.
We recognize that all technologies rearrange power.
We are critical of how AI shifts power. In particular, we recognize AI is frequently extractive, exploitative, surveilling, controlling, prescriptive, and reductionist. We recognize AI frequently prevents consent, deliberation, investigation, intervention, resistance, and agency.
We recognize the privilege of being adjacent to institutions creating technologies. We use this privilege to step up to expose oppressive technologies and to center those harmed, and to step back, ceding power, listening, and co-conspiring when those voices speak.
We value dreaming up and building human/AI systems that put power in the hands of the people. We recognize this is vulnerable and important work.
We recognize that reforming harmful AI can reduce harm to some while legitimizing (“ethics-washing”) systems still harming others2. Only by understanding the root of the harm and centering those most impacted can we make these complex tactical decisions, deciding when to minimize harm done by AI and when to call for its abolition3. We recognize that no one has a ‘view from nowhere’4. We practice reflexivity, naming who we are, how who we are influences what we do, and whose perspectives are missing.

At the Radical AI for Social Good Lab, we’re dedicated to leveraging AI responsibly. Our core mission is to democratize AI technology, making it a catalyst for education, social mobility, and equitable progress across global communities.

agent=Resume Content Selector2024-06-25 21:24:15: task=Assess the relevance of each section in the applicant's profile and prioritize them based on their alignment with the provided job specifications. 
**Input Data Might Include**: - Education, Relevant Courses, Volunteer Work, Awards, References, Traits, Miscellaneous
**Procedure**: 1. **Relevance Assessment**: Evaluate each section's relevance to the job's requirements. 2. **Prioritization**:
   - You can safely ignore the "Skills" section. Do not include it in the output.
   - Ignore empty sections.
   - If available, "Relevant Coursework" is a section of its own. Do not make it a sub-section of Education. 
   - Always prioritize at least one "Reference" sub-section if available.
   - Focus on recent and impactful achievements and qualifications.
   - Highlight Education and Awards for their impact.
   - Consider broader sections like Personal Traits if they offer significant benefits.

**Output**: - A JSON object listing sections and sub-sections prioritized by their relevance and impact, ready for final selection in the next task. No need for explanations, reasons or justifications in the output. The output will be in order of priority and their respective sub-sections. Do not remove sub-section fields. Example: ```json {
  "Prioritized Section": {
    "Education": [{Sub-section 1}, {Sub-section 2}],

Artificial Intelligence Engineer

About Radical AI:

Radical AI Principles
We recognize that power is distributed unevenly, and People of Color, Black, Indigenous, Women, Queer, Trans, Gender Non-Conforming, Poor, Dis-abled, and other communities are pushed to the margins. We commit to resisting these interlocking systems of oppression, including Racism, Coloniality, Casteism, Heteropatriarchy, Capitalism, and Ableism. We commit to striving toward collective liberation.1
We center radical work by communities at the margins.
We recognize that all technologies rearrange power.
We are critical of how AI shifts power. In particular, we recognize AI is frequently extractive, exploitative, surveilling, controlling, prescriptive, and reductionist. We recognize AI frequently prevents consent, deliberation, investigation, intervention, resistance, and agency.
We recognize the privilege of being adjacent to institutions creating technologies. We use this privilege to step up to expose oppressive technologies and to center those harmed, and to step back, ceding power, listening, and co-conspiring when those voices speak.
We value dreaming up and building human/AI systems that put power in the hands of the people. We recognize this is vulnerable and important work.
We recognize that reforming harmful AI can reduce harm to some while legitimizing (“ethics-washing”) systems still harming others2. Only by understanding the root of the harm and centering those most impacted can we make these complex tactical decisions, deciding when to minimize harm done by AI and when to call for its abolition3. We recognize that no one has a ‘view from nowhere’4. We practice reflexivity, naming who we are, how who we are influences what we do, and whose perspectives are missing.

At the Radical AI for Social Good Lab, we’re dedicated to leveraging AI responsibly. Our core mission is to democratize AI technology, making it a catalyst for education, social mobility, and equitable progress across global communities.

About Radical AI:

Radical AI Principles
We recognize that power is distributed unevenly, and People of Color, Black, Indigenous, Women, Queer, Trans, Gender Non-Conforming, Poor, Dis-abled, and other communities are pushed to the margins. We commit to resisting these interlocking systems of oppression, including Racism, Coloniality, Casteism, Heteropatriarchy, Capitalism, and Ableism. We commit to striving toward collective liberation.1
We center radical work by communities at the margins.
We recognize that all technologies rearrange power.
We are critical of how AI shifts power. In particular, we recognize AI is frequently extractive, exploitative, surveilling, controlling, prescriptive, and reductionist. We recognize AI frequently prevents consent, deliberation, investigation, intervention, resistance, and agency.
We recognize the privilege of being adjacent to institutions creating technologies. We use this privilege to step up to expose oppressive technologies and to center those harmed, and to step back, ceding power, listening, and co-conspiring when those voices speak.
We value dreaming up and building human/AI systems that put power in the hands of the people. We recognize this is vulnerable and important work.
We recognize that reforming harmful AI can reduce harm to some while legitimizing (“ethics-washing”) systems still harming others2. Only by understanding the root of the harm and centering those most impacted can we make these complex tactical decisions, deciding when to minimize harm done by AI and when to call for its abolition3. We recognize that no one has a ‘view from nowhere’4. We practice reflexivity, naming who we are, how who we are influences what we do, and whose perspectives are missing.

At the Radical AI for Social Good Lab, we’re dedicated to leveraging AI responsibly. Our core mission is to democratize AI technology, making it a catalyst for education, social mobility, and equitable progress across global communities.

Artificial Intelligence Engineer

About Radical AI:

Radical AI Principles
We recognize that power is distributed unevenly, and People of Color, Black, Indigenous, Women, Queer, Trans, Gender Non-Conforming, Poor, Dis-abled, and other communities are pushed to the margins. We commit to resisting these interlocking systems of oppression, including Racism, Coloniality, Casteism, Heteropatriarchy, Capitalism, and Ableism. We commit to striving toward collective liberation.1
We center radical work by communities at the margins.
We recognize that all technologies rearrange power.
We are critical of how AI shifts power. In particular, we recognize AI is frequently extractive, exploitative, surveilling, controlling, prescriptive, and reductionist. We recognize AI frequently prevents consent, deliberation, investigation, intervention, resistance, and agency.
We recognize the privilege of being adjacent to institutions creating technologies. We use this privilege to step up to expose oppressive technologies and to center those harmed, and to step back, ceding power, listening, and co-conspiring when those voices speak.
We value dreaming up and building human/AI systems that put power in the hands of the people. We recognize this is vulnerable and important work.
We recognize that reforming harmful AI can reduce harm to some while legitimizing (“ethics-washing”) systems still harming others2. Only by understanding the root of the harm and centering those most impacted can we make these complex tactical decisions, deciding when to minimize harm done by AI and when to call for its abolition3. We recognize that no one has a ‘view from nowhere’4. We practice reflexivity, naming who we are, how who we are influences what we do, and whose perspectives are missing.

At the Radical AI for Social Good Lab, we’re dedicated to leveraging AI responsibly. Our core mission is to democratize AI technology, making it a catalyst for education, social mobility, and equitable progress across global communities.

agent=Key Highlights Selector2024-06-27 12:27:47: task=This task modifies the key highlights of each experience based on the total number of experiences.
**Procedure**: - First, check what is the value of "total object count:"
When Selecting Key Highlights:
  - If "total object count:" is 3; keep 3 key highlights per experience's "key highlights" array, removing the other ones. 
    -- However, If a link is present, allow 2 highlights (not 3) for that experience's "key highlights" array and remove the other ones.
  - Create a new field named "Allow Count" and add the number of key highlights allowed for each experience.
  - Create a new field named "Count Reason" and add the reason for the count.
    Example: 
    "total object count: 3" -> "Link is present, allow 2 key highlights."
    or 
    "total object count: 3" -> "Link is not present, allow 3 key highlights."
    or 
    "total object count: not 3" -> "Keep all key highlights."
  - Do not change any wording of any key highlights. 
  - If the condition is not met, keep the output as the same as the input.

**Procedure**: - Determine the value of "total object count":
**Selecting Key Highlights**:
  - If "total object count" is 3:
    -- Normally, retain 3 key highlights per experience.
    -- If a link is present within an experience, retain only 2 key highlights for that experience and add the link as the third highlight.
  - If "total object count" is less than or greater than 3, do not adjust the key highlights.
  
  - Add a new field "Allow Count" indicating the number of key highlights retained for each experience.
  - Add a new field "Count Reason" explaining why that specific number of highlights was retained, such as:
    Example:
    - "Link is present, allowed 2 key highlights as per rules."
    - "No link, allowed 3 key highlights as per rules."

- Ensure all key highlights maintain their original wording. - If none of the conditions apply, return the input unchanged.

**Procedure**: - Retrieve the "Allow Item Count" for each entry which dictates how many key highlights should be kept. - Trim the "Key Highlights" array to match the "Allow Item Count". Prioritize highlights that effectively describe the applicant's experience and achievements. - If the "Allow Item Count" exceeds the number of available key highlights, retain all existing highlights. - Remove the "Allow Item Count" field from each entry after adjusting the highlights.
**Output**: - Produce a JSON object that mirrors the input structure but with each entry's "Key Highlights" array adjusted to include only the allowed number of highlights as specified by "Allow Item Count".

About the job
Artificial Intelligence Engineer

About Radical AI:

Radical AI Principles
We recognize that power is distributed unevenly, and People of Color, Black, Indigenous, Women, Queer, Trans, Gender Non-Conforming, Poor, Dis-abled, and other communities are pushed to the margins. We commit to resisting these interlocking systems of oppression, including Racism, Coloniality, Casteism, Heteropatriarchy, Capitalism, and Ableism. We commit to striving toward collective liberation.1
We center radical work by communities at the margins.
We recognize that all technologies rearrange power.
We are critical of how AI shifts power. In particular, we recognize AI is frequently extractive, exploitative, surveilling, controlling, prescriptive, and reductionist. We recognize AI frequently prevents consent, deliberation, investigation, intervention, resistance, and agency.
We recognize the privilege of being adjacent to institutions creating technologies. We use this privilege to step up to expose oppressive technologies and to center those harmed, and to step back, ceding power, listening, and co-conspiring when those voices speak.
We value dreaming up and building human/AI systems that put power in the hands of the people. We recognize this is vulnerable and important work.
We recognize that reforming harmful AI can reduce harm to some while legitimizing (“ethics-washing”) systems still harming others2. Only by understanding the root of the harm and centering those most impacted can we make these complex tactical decisions, deciding when to minimize harm done by AI and when to call for its abolition3. We recognize that no one has a ‘view from nowhere’4. We practice reflexivity, naming who we are, how who we are influences what we do, and whose perspectives are missing.

At the Radical AI for Social Good Lab, we’re dedicated to leveraging AI responsibly. Our core mission is to democratize AI technology, making it a catalyst for education, social mobility, and equitable progress across global communities.

About the job
Artificial Intelligence Engineer

About Radical AI:

Radical AI Principles
We recognize that power is distributed unevenly, and People of Color, Black, Indigenous, Women, Queer, Trans, Gender Non-Conforming, Poor, Dis-abled, and other communities are pushed to the margins. We commit to resisting these interlocking systems of oppression, including Racism, Coloniality, Casteism, Heteropatriarchy, Capitalism, and Ableism. We commit to striving toward collective liberation.1
We center radical work by communities at the margins.
We recognize that all technologies rearrange power.
We are critical of how AI shifts power. In particular, we recognize AI is frequently extractive, exploitative, surveilling, controlling, prescriptive, and reductionist. We recognize AI frequently prevents consent, deliberation, investigation, intervention, resistance, and agency.
We recognize the privilege of being adjacent to institutions creating technologies. We use this privilege to step up to expose oppressive technologies and to center those harmed, and to step back, ceding power, listening, and co-conspiring when those voices speak.
We value dreaming up and building human/AI systems that put power in the hands of the people. We recognize this is vulnerable and important work.
We recognize that reforming harmful AI can reduce harm to some while legitimizing (“ethics-washing”) systems still harming others2. Only by understanding the root of the harm and centering those most impacted can we make these complex tactical decisions, deciding when to minimize harm done by AI and when to call for its abolition3. We recognize that no one has a ‘view from nowhere’4. We practice reflexivity, naming who we are, how who we are influences what we do, and whose perspectives are missing.

At the Radical AI for Social Good Lab, we’re dedicated to leveraging AI responsibly. Our core mission is to democratize AI technology, making it a catalyst for education, social mobility, and equitable progress across global communities.

**Input Data Might Include**: - Education, Relevant Courses, Volunteer Work, Awards, References, Traits, Miscellaneous
**Procedure**: 1. **Relevance Assessment**: Evaluate each section's relevance to the job's requirements. 2. **Prioritization**:
   - You can safely ignore the "Skills" section. Do not include it in the output.
   - Ignore empty sections.
   - If available, "Relevant Coursework" is a section of its own. Do not make it a sub-section of Education. 
   - Always prioritize at least one "Reference" sub-section if available.
   - Focus on recent and impactful achievements and qualifications.
   - Highlight Education and Awards for their impact.
   - Consider broader sections like Personal Traits if they offer significant benefits.

**Output**: - A JSON object listing sections and sub-sections prioritized by their relevance and impact, ready for final selection in the next task. No need for explanations, reasons or justifications in the output. The output will be in order of priority and their respective sub-sections. Do not remove sub-section fields. Example: ```json {

Artificial Intelligence Engineer

About Radical AI:

Radical AI Principles
We recognize that power is distributed unevenly, and People of Color, Black, Indigenous, Women, Queer, Trans, Gender Non-Conforming, Poor, Dis-abled, and other communities are pushed to the margins. We commit to resisting these interlocking systems of oppression, including Racism, Coloniality, Casteism, Heteropatriarchy, Capitalism, and Ableism. We commit to striving toward collective liberation.1
We center radical work by communities at the margins.
We recognize that all technologies rearrange power.
We are critical of how AI shifts power. In particular, we recognize AI is frequently extractive, exploitative, surveilling, controlling, prescriptive, and reductionist. We recognize AI frequently prevents consent, deliberation, investigation, intervention, resistance, and agency.
We recognize the privilege of being adjacent to institutions creating technologies. We use this privilege to step up to expose oppressive technologies and to center those harmed, and to step back, ceding power, listening, and co-conspiring when those voices speak.
We value dreaming up and building human/AI systems that put power in the hands of the people. We recognize this is vulnerable and important work.
We recognize that reforming harmful AI can reduce harm to some while legitimizing (“ethics-washing”) systems still harming others2. Only by understanding the root of the harm and centering those most impacted can we make these complex tactical decisions, deciding when to minimize harm done by AI and when to call for its abolition3. We recognize that no one has a ‘view from nowhere’4. We practice reflexivity, naming who we are, how who we are influences what we do, and whose perspectives are missing.

At the Radical AI for Social Good Lab, we’re dedicated to leveraging AI responsibly. Our core mission is to democratize AI technology, making it a catalyst for education, social mobility, and equitable progress across global communities.

**Procedure**:
  - For each experience entry, determine if a link is included.
  - Create a field "Link found" either "True" or "False" based on the presence of a link within that entry.
  - Create a field "Allow Item Count" with the determined value based on the rules below.

  Rules:
  - If a link is present, "Allow Item Count": "2". No need to actually remove anything.
  - If no link is present, "Allow Item Count": "3". No need to actually remove anything.
  - Do not change or remove any other content of the JSON object in the output.

**Output**: - A JSON object with the same entries as the input but with the "Link found" and "Allow Item Count" fields added.

About the job
Artificial Intelligence Engineer

About Radical AI:

Radical AI Principles
We recognize that power is distributed unevenly, and People of Color, Black, Indigenous, Women, Queer, Trans, Gender Non-Conforming, Poor, Dis-abled, and other communities are pushed to the margins. We commit to resisting these interlocking systems of oppression, including Racism, Coloniality, Casteism, Heteropatriarchy, Capitalism, and Ableism. We commit to striving toward collective liberation.1
We center radical work by communities at the margins.
We recognize that all technologies rearrange power.
We are critical of how AI shifts power. In particular, we recognize AI is frequently extractive, exploitative, surveilling, controlling, prescriptive, and reductionist. We recognize AI frequently prevents consent, deliberation, investigation, intervention, resistance, and agency.
We recognize the privilege of being adjacent to institutions creating technologies. We use this privilege to step up to expose oppressive technologies and to center those harmed, and to step back, ceding power, listening, and co-conspiring when those voices speak.
We value dreaming up and building human/AI systems that put power in the hands of the people. We recognize this is vulnerable and important work.
We recognize that reforming harmful AI can reduce harm to some while legitimizing (“ethics-washing”) systems still harming others2. Only by understanding the root of the harm and centering those most impacted can we make these complex tactical decisions, deciding when to minimize harm done by AI and when to call for its abolition3. We recognize that no one has a ‘view from nowhere’4. We practice reflexivity, naming who we are, how who we are influences what we do, and whose perspectives are missing.

About the job
Artificial Intelligence Engineer

About Radical AI:

Radical AI Principles
We recognize that power is distributed unevenly, and People of Color, Black, Indigenous, Women, Queer, Trans, Gender Non-Conforming, Poor, Dis-abled, and other communities are pushed to the margins. We commit to resisting these interlocking systems of oppression, including Racism, Coloniality, Casteism, Heteropatriarchy, Capitalism, and Ableism. We commit to striving toward collective liberation.1
We center radical work by communities at the margins.
We recognize that all technologies rearrange power.
We are critical of how AI shifts power. In particular, we recognize AI is frequently extractive, exploitative, surveilling, controlling, prescriptive, and reductionist. We recognize AI frequently prevents consent, deliberation, investigation, intervention, resistance, and agency.
We recognize the privilege of being adjacent to institutions creating technologies. We use this privilege to step up to expose oppressive technologies and to center those harmed, and to step back, ceding power, listening, and co-conspiring when those voices speak.
We value dreaming up and building human/AI systems that put power in the hands of the people. We recognize this is vulnerable and important work.
We recognize that reforming harmful AI can reduce harm to some while legitimizing (“ethics-washing”) systems still harming others2. Only by understanding the root of the harm and centering those most impacted can we make these complex tactical decisions, deciding when to minimize harm done by AI and when to call for its abolition3. We recognize that no one has a ‘view from nowhere’4. We practice reflexivity, naming who we are, how who we are influences what we do, and whose perspectives are missing.

At the Radical AI for Social Good Lab, we’re dedicated to leveraging AI responsibly. Our core mission is to democratize AI technology, making it a catalyst for education, social mobility, and equitable progress across global communities.

agent=Key Highlights Selector2024-06-27 19:24:10: task=Trim the "Key Highlights" for each entry based on the "Allow Key Highlights Count," ensuring that the highlights retained are most relevant to the job description.
**Procedure**: - Check what is the value of "Allow Key Highlights Count" for that entry. - You need to keep only the "Allow Key Highlights Count" number of key highlights for that entry. In case there are more key highlights, keep them based on the: 
  -- priority of relevance and impact.
  -- Demonstrate measurable achievements or skills critical to the job.
  -- Highlight significant contributions or use of key technologies.

**Output**: - A JSON object that mirrors the structure of the input but includes only the prioritized key highlights for each entry. - For Example, if "Allow Key Highlights Count" is "2", the "Key Highlights" array should contain only the best 2 highlights based on relevance and impact for that entry.  - Similar steps should be followed for all entries.

Artificial Intelligence Engineer

About Radical AI:

Radical AI Principles
We recognize that power is distributed unevenly, and People of Color, Black, Indigenous, Women, Queer, Trans, Gender Non-Conforming, Poor, Dis-abled, and other communities are pushed to the margins. We commit to resisting these interlocking systems of oppression, including Racism, Coloniality, Casteism, Heteropatriarchy, Capitalism, and Ableism. We commit to striving toward collective liberation.1
We center radical work by communities at the margins.
We recognize that all technologies rearrange power.
We are critical of how AI shifts power. In particular, we recognize AI is frequently extractive, exploitative, surveilling, controlling, prescriptive, and reductionist. We recognize AI frequently prevents consent, deliberation, investigation, intervention, resistance, and agency.
We recognize the privilege of being adjacent to institutions creating technologies. We use this privilege to step up to expose oppressive technologies and to center those harmed, and to step back, ceding power, listening, and co-conspiring when those voices speak.
We value dreaming up and building human/AI systems that put power in the hands of the people. We recognize this is vulnerable and important work.
We recognize that reforming harmful AI can reduce harm to some while legitimizing (“ethics-washing”) systems still harming others2. Only by understanding the root of the harm and centering those most impacted can we make these complex tactical decisions, deciding when to minimize harm done by AI and when to call for its abolition3. We recognize that no one has a ‘view from nowhere’4. We practice reflexivity, naming who we are, how who we are influences what we do, and whose perspectives are missing.

At the Radical AI for Social Good Lab, we’re dedicated to leveraging AI responsibly. Our core mission is to democratize AI technology, making it a catalyst for education, social mobility, and equitable progress across global communities.

About the job
Artificial Intelligence Engineer

About Radical AI:

Radical AI Principles
We recognize that power is distributed unevenly, and People of Color, Black, Indigenous, Women, Queer, Trans, Gender Non-Conforming, Poor, Dis-abled, and other communities are pushed to the margins. We commit to resisting these interlocking systems of oppression, including Racism, Coloniality, Casteism, Heteropatriarchy, Capitalism, and Ableism. We commit to striving toward collective liberation.1
We center radical work by communities at the margins.
We recognize that all technologies rearrange power.
We are critical of how AI shifts power. In particular, we recognize AI is frequently extractive, exploitative, surveilling, controlling, prescriptive, and reductionist. We recognize AI frequently prevents consent, deliberation, investigation, intervention, resistance, and agency.
We recognize the privilege of being adjacent to institutions creating technologies. We use this privilege to step up to expose oppressive technologies and to center those harmed, and to step back, ceding power, listening, and co-conspiring when those voices speak.
We value dreaming up and building human/AI systems that put power in the hands of the people. We recognize this is vulnerable and important work.
We recognize that reforming harmful AI can reduce harm to some while legitimizing (“ethics-washing”) systems still harming others2. Only by understanding the root of the harm and centering those most impacted can we make these complex tactical decisions, deciding when to minimize harm done by AI and when to call for its abolition3. We recognize that no one has a ‘view from nowhere’4. We practice reflexivity, naming who we are, how who we are influences what we do, and whose perspectives are missing.

At the Radical AI for Social Good Lab, we’re dedicated to leveraging AI responsibly. Our core mission is to democratize AI technology, making it a catalyst for education, social mobility, and equitable progress across global communities.

   - Always prioritize at least one "Reference" sub-section if available.
   - Focus on recent and impactful achievements and qualifications.
   - Highlight Education and Awards for their impact.
   - Consider broader sections like Personal Traits if they offer significant benefits.

**Output**: - A JSON object listing sections and sub-sections prioritized by their relevance and impact, ready for final selection in the next task. No need for explanations, reasons or justifications in the output. The output will be in order of priority and their respective sub-sections. Do not remove sub-section fields. Example: ```json {
  "Prioritized Section": {
    "Education": [{Sub-section 1}, {Sub-section 2}],

**Procedure**:
  - For each experience entry, determine if a link is included.
  - Create a field "Link found" either "True" or "False" based on the presence of a link within that entry.
  - Create a field "Allow Key Highlights Count" with the determined value based on the rules below.

  Rules:
  - If a link is present, "Allow Key Highlights Count": "2". No need to actually remove anything.
  - If no link is present, "Allow Key Highlights Count": "3". No need to actually remove anything.
  - Do not change or remove any other content of the JSON object in the output.

**Output**: - A JSON object with the same entries as the input and the "Link found" and "Allow Key Highlights Count" fields added.

**Procedure**: - Check what is the value of "Allow Key Highlights Count" for that entry. - You need to keep only the "Allow Key Highlights Count" number of key highlights for that entry. In case there are more key highlights, keep them based on the: 
  -- priority of relevance and impact.
  -- Demonstrate measurable achievements or skills critical to the job.
  -- Highlight significant contributions or use of key technologies.

**Output**: - A JSON object that mirrors the structure of the input but includes only the prioritized key highlights for each entry. - For Example, if "Allow Key Highlights Count" is "2", the "Key Highlights" array should contain only the best 2 highlights based on relevance and impact for that entry.  - Similar steps should be followed for all entries.

**Procedure**: - Check what is the value of "Allow Key Highlights Count" for that entry. - You need to keep only the "Allow Key Highlights Count" number of key highlights for that entry. In case there are more key highlights, keep them based on the: 
  -- priority of relevance and impact.
  -- Demonstrate measurable achievements or skills critical to the job.
  -- Highlight significant contributions or use of key technologies.

**Output**: - A JSON object that mirrors the structure of the input but includes only the prioritized key highlights for each entry. - For Example, if "Allow Key Highlights Count" is "2", the "Key Highlights" array should contain only the best 2 highlights based on relevance and impact for that entry.  - Similar steps should be followed for all entries.

**Procedure**: - Check what is the value of "Allow Key Highlights Count" for that entry. - You need to keep only the "Allow Key Highlights Count" number of key highlights for that entry. In case there are more key highlights, keep them based on the: 
  -- priority of relevance and impact.
  -- Demonstrate measurable achievements or skills critical to the job.
  -- Highlight significant contributions or use of key technologies.

**Output**: - A JSON object that mirrors the structure of the input but includes only the prioritized key highlights for each entry. - For Example, if "Allow Key Highlights Count" is "2", the "Key Highlights" array should contain only the best 2 highlights based on relevance and impact for that entry.  - Similar steps should be followed for all entries.

**Procedure**: - Check what is the value of "Allow Key Highlights Count" for that entry. - You need to keep only the "Allow Key Highlights Count" number of key highlights for that entry. In case there are more key highlights, keep them based on the: 
  -- priority of relevance and impact.
  -- Demonstrate measurable achievements or skills critical to the job.
  -- Highlight significant contributions or use of key technologies.

**Output**: - A JSON object that mirrors the structure of the input but includes only the prioritized key highlights for each entry. - For Example, if "Allow Key Highlights Count" is "2", the "Key Highlights" array should contain only the best 2 highlights based on relevance and impact for that entry.  - Similar steps should be followed for all entries.

The business is seeking curious, growth-minded thinkers to help shape our vision, structures and systems; playing a key-role as we launch into our ambitious future. If you’re invigorated by our mission, values, and drive to change the world — we’d love to have you apply.

About the team + role

Join our Reliability Engineering team, focused on designing, evolving, and maintaining large-scale distributed systems. As a Software Developer, you'll collaborate across teams to build robust, scalable systems that ensure high availability and low latency.

The Reliability team currently has two significant areas of focus

Building our company wide software system that tracks all outages/SEVs for the organization. A sophisticated tool where all product/infra teams collaborate to identify, remediate, and track significant outages.
Track and monitor our most critical workflows for the business, identifying issues early and being a critical component of long term reliable performance of these core workflows.

As Software Developer, you will combine your software and systems knowledge to engineer distributed systems that are reliable, scaleable and fault-tolerant for Robinhood. You will be part of the larger infrastructure organization where you will work cross functionally with other infra teams to make that a reality.

Our technology stack is primarily built using Python/Go and implemented using container orchestration technologies such as Kubernetes. We also build our systems using microservice-oriented architectures and related OSS technologies (e.g Kafka, Celery/RabbitMQ, nginx, Redis, Postgres, Airflow, Consul, etc.). Our systems are primarily built within AWS.

What you’ll do

Design and Implement new features and services with a focus on high availability, low latency, and scalability.
Continually optimize systems and workflows by improving architecture, infrastructure, automation, CI/CD and observability.
Act as an owner and leader of Robinhood's infrastructure by ensuring project infrastructure needs are met and working proactively with customer teams to help them improve reliability.

What you bring

Fluent in one or more programming languages (e.g. Go, Python, Java).
Experience authoring and operating high-scale services.
Experience with scalable distributed systems, either built from scratch or on public Cloud (e.g. AWS) primitives.
Pluses if you have experience with Python/Django/Go and AWS

Our team is here to enable an inclusive and welcoming interview experience for all candidates. If you need additional assistance throughout the interview process related to a physical or mental condition, or if there is something our team can do to enable a more accessible experience at any time, please notify our team by completing this Applicant Accommodation Form.

We’re looking for more growth-minded and collaborative people to be a part of our journey in democratizing finance for all. If you’re ready to give 100% in helping us achieve our mission—we’d love to have you apply even if you feel unsure about whether you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Robinhood, we're looking for people invigorated by our mission, values, and drive to change the world, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.

Robinhood embraces a diversity of backgrounds and experiences and provides equal opportunity for all applicants and employees. We are dedicated to building a company that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. We believe that the more inclusive we are, the better our work (and work environment) will be for everyone. Additionally, Robinhood provides reasonable accommodations for candidates on request and respects applicants' privacy rights.

**Procedure**: - Check what is the value of "Allow Key Highlights Count" for that entry. - You need to keep only the "Allow Key Highlights Count" number of key highlights for that entry. In case there are more key highlights, keep them based on the: 
  -- priority of relevance and impact.
  -- Demonstrate measurable achievements or skills critical to the job.
  -- Highlight significant contributions or use of key technologies.

**Output**: - A JSON object that mirrors the structure of the input but includes only the prioritized key highlights for each entry. - For Example, if "Allow Key Highlights Count" is "2", the "Key Highlights" array should contain only the best 2 highlights based on relevance and impact for that entry.  - Similar steps should be followed for all entries.

Join a leading fintech company that’s democratizing finance for all.

Robinhood Markets was founded on a simple idea: that our financial markets should be accessible to all. With customers at the heart of our decisions, Robinhood and its subsidiaries and affiliates are lowering barriers and providing greater access to financial information. Together, we are building products and services that help create a financial system everyone can participate in.
With growth as the top priority...

The business is seeking curious, growth-minded thinkers to help shape our vision, structures and systems; playing a key-role as we launch into our ambitious future. If you’re invigorated by our mission, values, and drive to change the world — we’d love to have you apply.

About the team + role

Join our Reliability Engineering team, focused on designing, evolving, and maintaining large-scale distributed systems. As a Software Developer, you'll collaborate across teams to build robust, scalable systems that ensure high availability and low latency.

The Reliability team currently has two significant areas of focus

Building our company wide software system that tracks all outages/SEVs for the organization. A sophisticated tool where all product/infra teams collaborate to identify, remediate, and track significant outages.
Track and monitor our most critical workflows for the business, identifying issues early and being a critical component of long term reliable performance of these core workflows.

As Software Developer, you will combine your software and systems knowledge to engineer distributed systems that are reliable, scaleable and fault-tolerant for Robinhood. You will be part of the larger infrastructure organization where you will work cross functionally with other infra teams to make that a reality.

Our technology stack is primarily built using Python/Go and implemented using container orchestration technologies such as Kubernetes. We also build our systems using microservice-oriented architectures and related OSS technologies (e.g Kafka, Celery/RabbitMQ, nginx, Redis, Postgres, Airflow, Consul, etc.). Our systems are primarily built within AWS.

What you’ll do

Design and Implement new features and services with a focus on high availability, low latency, and scalability.
Continually optimize systems and workflows by improving architecture, infrastructure, automation, CI/CD and observability.
Act as an owner and leader of Robinhood's infrastructure by ensuring project infrastructure needs are met and working proactively with customer teams to help them improve reliability.

What you bring

Fluent in one or more programming languages (e.g. Go, Python, Java).
Experience authoring and operating high-scale services.
Experience with scalable distributed systems, either built from scratch or on public Cloud (e.g. AWS) primitives.
Pluses if you have experience with Python/Django/Go and AWS

Our team is here to enable an inclusive and welcoming interview experience for all candidates. If you need additional assistance throughout the interview process related to a physical or mental condition, or if there is something our team can do to enable a more accessible experience at any time, please notify our team by completing this Applicant Accommodation Form.

We’re looking for more growth-minded and collaborative people to be a part of our journey in democratizing finance for all. If you’re ready to give 100% in helping us achieve our mission—we’d love to have you apply even if you feel unsure about whether you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Robinhood, we're looking for people invigorated by our mission, values, and drive to change the world, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.

Robinhood embraces a diversity of backgrounds and experiences and provides equal opportunity for all applicants and employees. We are dedicated to building a company that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. We believe that the more inclusive we are, the better our work (and work environment) will be for everyone.

Join a leading fintech company that’s democratizing finance for all.

Robinhood Markets was founded on a simple idea: that our financial markets should be accessible to all. With customers at the heart of our decisions, Robinhood and its subsidiaries and affiliates are lowering barriers and providing greater access to financial information. Together, we are building products and services that help create a financial system everyone can participate in.
With growth as the top priority...

The business is seeking curious, growth-minded thinkers to help shape our vision, structures and systems; playing a key-role as we launch into our ambitious future. If you’re invigorated by our mission, values, and drive to change the world — we’d love to have you apply.

About the team + role

Join our Reliability Engineering team, focused on designing, evolving, and maintaining large-scale distributed systems. As a Software Developer, you'll collaborate across teams to build robust, scalable systems that ensure high availability and low latency.

The Reliability team currently has two significant areas of focus

Building our company wide software system that tracks all outages/SEVs for the organization. A sophisticated tool where all product/infra teams collaborate to identify, remediate, and track significant outages.
Track and monitor our most critical workflows for the business, identifying issues early and being a critical component of long term reliable performance of these core workflows.

As Software Developer, you will combine your software and systems knowledge to engineer distributed systems that are reliable, scaleable and fault-tolerant for Robinhood. You will be part of the larger infrastructure organization where you will work cross functionally with other infra teams to make that a reality.

Our technology stack is primarily built using Python/Go and implemented using container orchestration technologies such as Kubernetes. We also build our systems using microservice-oriented architectures and related OSS technologies (e.g Kafka, Celery/RabbitMQ, nginx, Redis, Postgres, Airflow, Consul, etc.). Our systems are primarily built within AWS.

What you’ll do

Design and Implement new features and services with a focus on high availability, low latency, and scalability.
Continually optimize systems and workflows by improving architecture, infrastructure, automation, CI/CD and observability.
Act as an owner and leader of Robinhood's infrastructure by ensuring project infrastructure needs are met and working proactively with customer teams to help them improve reliability.

What you bring

Fluent in one or more programming languages (e.g. Go, Python, Java).
Experience authoring and operating high-scale services.
Experience with scalable distributed systems, either built from scratch or on public Cloud (e.g. AWS) primitives.
Pluses if you have experience with Python/Django/Go and AWS

Our team is here to enable an inclusive and welcoming interview experience for all candidates. If you need additional assistance throughout the interview process related to a physical or mental condition, or if there is something our team can do to enable a more accessible experience at any time, please notify our team by completing this Applicant Accommodation Form.

We’re looking for more growth-minded and collaborative people to be a part of our journey in democratizing finance for all. If you’re ready to give 100% in helping us achieve our mission—we’d love to have you apply even if you feel unsure about whether you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Robinhood, we're looking for people invigorated by our mission, values, and drive to change the world, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.

Robinhood embraces a diversity of backgrounds and experiences and provides equal opportunity for all applicants and employees. We are dedicated to building a company that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. We believe that the more inclusive we are, the better our work (and work environment) will be for everyone. Additionally, Robinhood provides reasonable accommodations for candidates on request and respects applicants' privacy rights.

**Procedure**:
  - For each experience entry, determine if a link is included.
  - Create a field "Link found" either "True" or "False" based on the presence of a link within that entry.
  - Create a field "Allow Key Highlights Count" with the determined value based on the rules below.

  Rules:
  - If a link is present, "Allow Key Highlights Count": "2". No need to actually remove anything.
  - If no link is present, "Allow Key Highlights Count": "3". No need to actually remove anything.
  - Do not change or remove any other content of the JSON object in the output.

**Output**: - A JSON object with the same entries as the input and the "Link found" and "Allow Key Highlights Count" fields added.

**About the team + role**
Join our Reliability Engineering team, focused on designing, evolving, and maintaining large-scale distributed systems. As a Software Developer, you'll collaborate across teams to build robust, scalable systems that ensure high availability and low latency.

The Reliability team currently has two significant areas of focus:
* Building our company wide software system that tracks all outages/SEVs for the organization. A sophisticated tool where all product/infra teams collaborate to identify, remediate, and track significant outages.
* Track and monitor our most critical workflows for the business, identifying issues early and being a critical component of long term reliable performance of these core workflows.

As Software Developer, you will combine your software and systems knowledge to engineer distributed systems that are reliable, scaleable and fault-tolerant for Robinhood. You will be part of the larger infrastructure organization where you will work cross functionally with other infra teams to make that a reality.

Our technology stack is primarily built using Python/Go and implemented using container orchestration technologies such as Kubernetes. We also build our systems using microservice-oriented architectures and related OSS technologies (e.g Kafka, Celery/RabbitMQ, nginx, Redis, Postgres, Airflow, Consul, etc.). Our systems are primarily built within AWS.

**What you’ll do**
* Design and Implement new features and services with a focus on high availability, low latency, and scalability.
* Continually optimize systems and workflows by improving architecture, infrastructure, automation, CI/CD and observability.
* Act as an owner and leader of Robinhood's infrastructure by ensuring project infrastructure needs are met and working proactively with customer teams to help them improve reliability.

**What you bring**
* Fluent in one or more programming languages (e.g. Go, Python, Java).
* Experience authoring and operating high-scale services.
* Experience with scalable distributed systems, either built from scratch or on public Cloud (e.g. AWS) primitives.
* Pluses if you have experience with Python/Django/Go and AWS

**About the team + role**
Join our Reliability Engineering team, focused on designing, evolving, and maintaining large-scale distributed systems. As a Software Developer, you'll collaborate across teams to build robust, scalable systems that ensure high availability and low latency.

The Reliability team currently has two significant areas of focus:
* Building our company wide software system that tracks all outages/SEVs for the organization. A sophisticated tool where all product/infra teams collaborate to identify, remediate, and track significant outages.
* Track and monitor our most critical workflows for the business, identifying issues early and being a critical component of long term reliable performance of these core workflows.

As Software Developer, you will combine your software and systems knowledge to engineer distributed systems that are reliable, scaleable and fault-tolerant for Robinhood. You will be part of the larger infrastructure organization where you will work cross functionally with other infra teams to make that a reality.

Our technology stack is primarily built using Python/Go and implemented using container orchestration technologies such as Kubernetes. We also build our systems using microservice-oriented architectures and related OSS technologies (e.g Kafka, Celery/RabbitMQ, nginx, Redis, Postgres, Airflow, Consul, etc.). Our systems are primarily built within AWS.

**What you’ll do**
* Design and Implement new features and services with a focus on high availability, low latency, and scalability.
* Continually optimize systems and workflows by improving architecture, infrastructure, automation, CI/CD and observability.
* Act as an owner and leader of Robinhood's infrastructure by ensuring project infrastructure needs are met and working proactively with customer teams to help them improve reliability.

**What you bring**
* Fluent in one or more programming languages (e.g. Go, Python, Java).
* Experience authoring and operating high-scale services.
* Experience with scalable distributed systems, either built from scratch or on public Cloud (e.g. AWS) primitives.
* Pluses if you have experience with Python/Django/Go and AWS
