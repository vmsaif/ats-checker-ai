Artificial Intelligence Engineer

About Radical AI:

Radical AI Principles
We recognize that power is distributed unevenly, and People of Color, Black, Indigenous, Women, Queer, Trans, Gender Non-Conforming, Poor, Dis-abled, and other communities are pushed to the margins. We commit to resisting these interlocking systems of oppression, including Racism, Coloniality, Casteism, Heteropatriarchy, Capitalism, and Ableism. We commit to striving toward collective liberation.1
We center radical work by communities at the margins.
We recognize that all technologies rearrange power.
We are critical of how AI shifts power. In particular, we recognize AI is frequently extractive, exploitative, surveilling, controlling, prescriptive, and reductionist. We recognize AI frequently prevents consent, deliberation, investigation, intervention, resistance, and agency.
We recognize the privilege of being adjacent to institutions creating technologies. We use this privilege to step up to expose oppressive technologies and to center those harmed, and to step back, ceding power, listening, and co-conspiring when those voices speak.
We value dreaming up and building human/AI systems that put power in the hands of the people. We recognize this is vulnerable and important work.
We recognize that reforming harmful AI can reduce harm to some while legitimizing (“ethics-washing”) systems still harming others2. Only by understanding the root of the harm and centering those most impacted can we make these complex tactical decisions, deciding when to minimize harm done by AI and when to call for its abolition3. We recognize that no one has a ‘view from nowhere’4. We practice reflexivity, naming who we are, how who we are influences what we do, and whose perspectives are missing.

At the Radical AI for Social Good Lab, we’re dedicated to leveraging AI responsibly. Our core mission is to democratize AI technology, making it a catalyst for education, social mobility, and equitable progress across global communities.

About Radical AI:

Radical AI Principles
We recognize that power is distributed unevenly, and People of Color, Black, Indigenous, Women, Queer, Trans, Gender Non-Conforming, Poor, Dis-abled, and other communities are pushed to the margins. We commit to resisting these interlocking systems of oppression, including Racism, Coloniality, Casteism, Heteropatriarchy, Capitalism, and Ableism. We commit to striving toward collective liberation.1
We center radical work by communities at the margins.
We recognize that all technologies rearrange power.
We are critical of how AI shifts power. In particular, we recognize AI is frequently extractive, exploitative, surveilling, controlling, prescriptive, and reductionist. We recognize AI frequently prevents consent, deliberation, investigation, intervention, resistance, and agency.
We recognize the privilege of being adjacent to institutions creating technologies. We use this privilege to step up to expose oppressive technologies and to center those harmed, and to step back, ceding power, listening, and co-conspiring when those voices speak.
We value dreaming up and building human/AI systems that put power in the hands of the people. We recognize this is vulnerable and important work.
We recognize that reforming harmful AI can reduce harm to some while legitimizing (“ethics-washing”) systems still harming others2. Only by understanding the root of the harm and centering those most impacted can we make these complex tactical decisions, deciding when to minimize harm done by AI and when to call for its abolition3. We recognize that no one has a ‘view from nowhere’4. We practice reflexivity, naming who we are, how who we are influences what we do, and whose perspectives are missing.

At the Radical AI for Social Good Lab, we’re dedicated to leveraging AI responsibly. Our core mission is to democratize AI technology, making it a catalyst for education, social mobility, and equitable progress across global communities.

Artificial Intelligence Engineer

About Radical AI:

Radical AI Principles
We recognize that power is distributed unevenly, and People of Color, Black, Indigenous, Women, Queer, Trans, Gender Non-Conforming, Poor, Dis-abled, and other communities are pushed to the margins. We commit to resisting these interlocking systems of oppression, including Racism, Coloniality, Casteism, Heteropatriarchy, Capitalism, and Ableism. We commit to striving toward collective liberation.1
We center radical work by communities at the margins.
We recognize that all technologies rearrange power.
We are critical of how AI shifts power. In particular, we recognize AI is frequently extractive, exploitative, surveilling, controlling, prescriptive, and reductionist. We recognize AI frequently prevents consent, deliberation, investigation, intervention, resistance, and agency.
We recognize the privilege of being adjacent to institutions creating technologies. We use this privilege to step up to expose oppressive technologies and to center those harmed, and to step back, ceding power, listening, and co-conspiring when those voices speak.
We value dreaming up and building human/AI systems that put power in the hands of the people. We recognize this is vulnerable and important work.
We recognize that reforming harmful AI can reduce harm to some while legitimizing (“ethics-washing”) systems still harming others2. Only by understanding the root of the harm and centering those most impacted can we make these complex tactical decisions, deciding when to minimize harm done by AI and when to call for its abolition3. We recognize that no one has a ‘view from nowhere’4. We practice reflexivity, naming who we are, how who we are influences what we do, and whose perspectives are missing.

At the Radical AI for Social Good Lab, we’re dedicated to leveraging AI responsibly. Our core mission is to democratize AI technology, making it a catalyst for education, social mobility, and equitable progress across global communities.

We recognize that reforming harmful AI can reduce harm to some while legitimizing (“ethics-washing”) systems still harming others2. Only by understanding the root of the harm and centering those most impacted can we make these complex tactical decisions, deciding when to minimize harm done by AI and when to call for its abolition3. We recognize that no one has a ‘view from nowhere’4. We practice reflexivity, naming who we are, how who we are influences what we do, and whose perspectives are missing.

At the Radical AI for Social Good Lab, we’re dedicated to leveraging AI responsibly. Our core mission is to democratize AI technology, making it a catalyst for education, social mobility, and equitable progress across global communities.

About the job
Artificial Intelligence Engineer

About Radical AI:

Radical AI Principles
We recognize that power is distributed unevenly, and People of Color, Black, Indigenous, Women, Queer, Trans, Gender Non-Conforming, Poor, Dis-abled, and other communities are pushed to the margins. We commit to resisting these interlocking systems of oppression, including Racism, Coloniality, Casteism, Heteropatriarchy, Capitalism, and Ableism. We commit to striving toward collective liberation.1
We center radical work by communities at the margins.
We recognize that all technologies rearrange power.
We are critical of how AI shifts power. In particular, we recognize AI is frequently extractive, exploitative, surveilling, controlling, prescriptive, and reductionist. We recognize AI frequently prevents consent, deliberation, investigation, intervention, resistance, and agency.
We recognize the privilege of being adjacent to institutions creating technologies. We use this privilege to step up to expose oppressive technologies and to center those harmed, and to step back, ceding power, listening, and co-conspiring when those voices speak.
We value dreaming up and building human/AI systems that put power in the hands of the people. We recognize this is vulnerable and important work.
We recognize that reforming harmful AI can reduce harm to some while legitimizing (“ethics-washing”) systems still harming others2. Only by understanding the root of the harm and centering those most impacted can we make these complex tactical decisions, deciding when to minimize harm done by AI and when to call for its abolition3. We recognize that no one has a ‘view from nowhere’4. We practice reflexivity, naming who we are, how who we are influences what we do, and whose perspectives are missing.

At the Radical AI for Social Good Lab, we’re dedicated to leveraging AI responsibly. Our core mission is to democratize AI technology, making it a catalyst for education, social mobility, and equitable progress across global communities.

agent=Resume Content Selector2024-06-25 21:24:15: task=Assess the relevance of each section in the applicant's profile and prioritize them based on their alignment with the provided job specifications. 
**Input Data Might Include**: - Education, Relevant Courses, Volunteer Work, Awards, References, Traits, Miscellaneous
**Procedure**: 1. **Relevance Assessment**: Evaluate each section's relevance to the job's requirements. 2. **Prioritization**:
   - You can safely ignore the "Skills" section. Do not include it in the output.
   - Ignore empty sections.
   - If available, "Relevant Coursework" is a section of its own. Do not make it a sub-section of Education. 
   - Always prioritize at least one "Reference" sub-section if available.
   - Focus on recent and impactful achievements and qualifications.
   - Highlight Education and Awards for their impact.
   - Consider broader sections like Personal Traits if they offer significant benefits.

**Output**: - A JSON object listing sections and sub-sections prioritized by their relevance and impact, ready for final selection in the next task. No need for explanations, reasons or justifications in the output. The output will be in order of priority and their respective sub-sections. Do not remove sub-section fields. Example: ```json {
  "Prioritized Section": {
    "Education": [{Sub-section 1}, {Sub-section 2}],

Artificial Intelligence Engineer

About Radical AI:

Radical AI Principles
We recognize that power is distributed unevenly, and People of Color, Black, Indigenous, Women, Queer, Trans, Gender Non-Conforming, Poor, Dis-abled, and other communities are pushed to the margins. We commit to resisting these interlocking systems of oppression, including Racism, Coloniality, Casteism, Heteropatriarchy, Capitalism, and Ableism. We commit to striving toward collective liberation.1
We center radical work by communities at the margins.
We recognize that all technologies rearrange power.
We are critical of how AI shifts power. In particular, we recognize AI is frequently extractive, exploitative, surveilling, controlling, prescriptive, and reductionist. We recognize AI frequently prevents consent, deliberation, investigation, intervention, resistance, and agency.
We recognize the privilege of being adjacent to institutions creating technologies. We use this privilege to step up to expose oppressive technologies and to center those harmed, and to step back, ceding power, listening, and co-conspiring when those voices speak.
We value dreaming up and building human/AI systems that put power in the hands of the people. We recognize this is vulnerable and important work.
We recognize that reforming harmful AI can reduce harm to some while legitimizing (“ethics-washing”) systems still harming others2. Only by understanding the root of the harm and centering those most impacted can we make these complex tactical decisions, deciding when to minimize harm done by AI and when to call for its abolition3. We recognize that no one has a ‘view from nowhere’4. We practice reflexivity, naming who we are, how who we are influences what we do, and whose perspectives are missing.

At the Radical AI for Social Good Lab, we’re dedicated to leveraging AI responsibly. Our core mission is to democratize AI technology, making it a catalyst for education, social mobility, and equitable progress across global communities.

About Radical AI:

Radical AI Principles
We recognize that power is distributed unevenly, and People of Color, Black, Indigenous, Women, Queer, Trans, Gender Non-Conforming, Poor, Dis-abled, and other communities are pushed to the margins. We commit to resisting these interlocking systems of oppression, including Racism, Coloniality, Casteism, Heteropatriarchy, Capitalism, and Ableism. We commit to striving toward collective liberation.1
We center radical work by communities at the margins.
We recognize that all technologies rearrange power.
We are critical of how AI shifts power. In particular, we recognize AI is frequently extractive, exploitative, surveilling, controlling, prescriptive, and reductionist. We recognize AI frequently prevents consent, deliberation, investigation, intervention, resistance, and agency.
We recognize the privilege of being adjacent to institutions creating technologies. We use this privilege to step up to expose oppressive technologies and to center those harmed, and to step back, ceding power, listening, and co-conspiring when those voices speak.
We value dreaming up and building human/AI systems that put power in the hands of the people. We recognize this is vulnerable and important work.
We recognize that reforming harmful AI can reduce harm to some while legitimizing (“ethics-washing”) systems still harming others2. Only by understanding the root of the harm and centering those most impacted can we make these complex tactical decisions, deciding when to minimize harm done by AI and when to call for its abolition3. We recognize that no one has a ‘view from nowhere’4. We practice reflexivity, naming who we are, how who we are influences what we do, and whose perspectives are missing.

At the Radical AI for Social Good Lab, we’re dedicated to leveraging AI responsibly. Our core mission is to democratize AI technology, making it a catalyst for education, social mobility, and equitable progress across global communities.

Organize the experiences as follows: - Title: Use \customTitle{Project/Experience Title}. - Summary points: use \summaryPoints{item 1 | item 2 | item 3}.  - Role and timeline: The provided role and its duration using \roleAndTimeline{Role | Timeline}. - Short description: use \shortDescription{Short Description}. - Key responsibilities and achievements: 
  -- start 'tightemize' environment with \begin{tightemize} 
  -- Each entry of "Key Highlights" will be each \item.
  -- End the environment with \end{tightemize}.

Special Character Handling: - Use textbf{} for texts surrounded by double asterisks (**text**) in the "Key Highlights" array. - Format links with \href{}{}, using \ul for underlining. - Escape special characters appropriately (e.g., \%, \&, \#).
