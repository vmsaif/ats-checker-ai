2024-06-02 23:42:06: task=Convert the volunteer work information of the applicant from the provided data into the LaTeX format, focusing on organization, clarity, and adherence to LaTeX syntax conventions.
**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization names up to 22 characters.
   - For names longer than 22 characters, use `\subHeading{}` to ensure the name fits without breaking LaTeX formatting.
   - If the organization name is too long for one line, split the name at an appropriate point and continue on the next line with `\subHeading{}`.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) and separate them with `\newline` to clearly delineate individual tasks or contributions.

5. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

6. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Example Outputs**:
**Example 1 - Short Organization Name**:
\section{VOLUNTEER} \subsection{.dev Programming Club} \subHeading{Active Member | University of Manitoba Students Union (UMSU) | 2019-2023} - Engaged with the latest software development technologies and tools. \newline - Collaborated on team projects focused on Python and Cloud Technologies. \sectionsep
**Example 2 - Long Organization Name**:
\section{VOLUNTEER} \subHeading{Student Union of University of Manitoba} % Using \subHeading{} due to length \subHeading{Active Member | 2019-2023} - Engaged with the latest software development technologies and tools. \newline - Collaborated on team projects focused on Python and Cloud Technologies. \sectionsep
**Spacing Between Sections**: - Use `\skillsVSpace` to add vertical spacing before starting a new `\section{}` if another section follows the volunteer section.
**Conditions**: - Only generate the `\section{VOLUNTEER}` if there is at least one volunteer entry. If no entries are provided, leave the output blank without placeholder LaTeX comments.

2024-06-02 23:45:23: task=Convert the volunteer work information of the applicant from the provided data into the LaTeX format, focusing on organization, clarity, and adherence to LaTeX syntax conventions.
**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization names up to 22 characters.
   - For names longer than 22 characters, use `\subHeading{}` to ensure the name fits without breaking LaTeX formatting.
   - If the organization name is too long for one line, split the name at an appropriate point and continue on the next line with `\subHeading{}`.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) and separate them with `\newline` to clearly delineate individual tasks or contributions.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\sectionsep` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   

5. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

6. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Example Outputs**:
**Example 1 - Short Organization Name**:
\section{VOLUNTEER} \subsection{.dev Programming Club} \subHeading{Active Member | University of Manitoba Students Union (UMSU) | 2019-2023} - Engaged with the latest software development technologies and tools. \newline - Collaborated on team projects focused on Python and Cloud Technologies. \sectionsep

**Spacing Between Sections**: - Use `\skillsVSpace` to add vertical spacing before starting a new `\section{}` if another section follows the volunteer section.
**Conditions**: - Only generate the `\section{VOLUNTEER}` if there is at least one volunteer entry. If no entries are provided, leave the output blank without placeholder LaTeX comments.

2024-06-02 23:53:03: task=Convert the volunteer work information of the applicant from the provided data into the LaTeX format, focusing on organization, clarity, and adherence to LaTeX syntax conventions.
**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization names up to 20 characters.
   - For organization names longer than 20 characters, use `\subHeading{}` instead of '\subsection{}'. This is to maintain consistent formatting and avoid layout issues.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) and separate them with `\newline` to clearly delineate individual tasks or contributions.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\sectionsep` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Example Outputs**:
**Example 1 - Short Organization Name**:
\section{VOLUNTEER} \subsection{.dev Programming Club} \subHeading{Active Member | University of Manitoba Students Union (UMSU) | 2019-2023} - Engaged with the latest software development technologies and tools. \newline - Collaborated on team projects focused on Python and Cloud Technologies. \sectionsep

**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization names less than 20 characters. Otherwise, use `\subHeading{}` to maintain consistent formatting and avoid layout issues.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\skillsVSpace \skillsVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. Otherwise, use `\subHeading{}` to maintain consistent formatting and avoid layout issues.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Example Outputs**:
**Example 1 - Short Organization Name**:

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\subHeading{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\subHeading{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\subHeading{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Example Outputs**:
**Example 1 - Short Organization Name**:
\section{VOLUNTEER} \subsection{.dev Programming Club} \subHeading{Active Member | University of Manitoba Students Union (UMSU) | 2019-2023} - Engaged with the latest software development technologies and tools. \\ - Collaborated on team projects focused on Python and Cloud Technologies.  \entryVSpace \sectionsep

**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\subHeading{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\subHeading{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`

2024-06-04 09:20:51: task=Convert the volunteer work information of the applicant from the provided data into the LaTeX format, focusing on organization, clarity, and adherence to LaTeX syntax conventions.
**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\subHeading{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\subHeading{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\subHeading{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\subHeading{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command if volunteer data is available. If no data is provided, the output should remain empty.

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\subHeading{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subHeading{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) always use `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\entryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:

   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\smallSubSection{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Organization | Year-Year`. Use `\subTitle{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) and end with `\\` for line breaks, exepct the last one. 

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\newEntryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Example Outputs**:
**Example 1**: First Decide if to use `\subsection{}` or `\smallSubSection{}` based on the length of the organization name for all entries. The command should be same for all entries.

2024-06-06 23:05:58: task=Convert the volunteer work information of the applicant from the provided data into the LaTeX format, focusing on organization, clarity, and adherence to LaTeX syntax conventions.
**Task Details**:
1. **Section Header**:
   - Begin with a `\section{VOLUNTEER}` command. 

2. **Organization Name**:
   - Use `\subsection{}` for organization name less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\smallSubSection{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization names entries.

3. **Role and Timeline**:
   - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Timeline`. Use `\subTitle{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.

4. **Responsibilities**:
   - List each responsibility starting with a dash (`-`) and end with `\\` for line breaks.

5. **Adding Another Entry**:
    - If there are multiple volunteer entries, use `\newEntryVSpace` to separate each entry and maintain a consistent structure.
   
6. **Section Separator**:
   - Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections.

7. **Special Character Handling**:
   - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
     - `%` to `\%`
     - `$` to `\$`
     - `&` to `\&`
     - `#` to `\#`
     - `_` to `\_`

**Example Outputs**:
**Example 1**: First Decide if to use `\subsection{}` or `\smallSubSection{}` based on the length of the organization name for all entries. The command should be same for all entries.

agent=Resume Content Selector2024-06-11 17:55:22: task=This task involves selecting the most relevant sections and their respective sub-sections from an applicant's comprehensive profile for inclusion in the first column of a one-page A4 resume. Given the limited space (less than half of the page width), the selection must prioritize content that aligns closely with the requirements and preferences outlined in the provided job description. 
The applicant's information provided in JSON format includes potential sections such as Education, Volunteer Work, Awards and Recognitions, References, Personal Traits and Interests, and Miscellaneous.
**Procedure**: 1. **Assess Relevance**: Compare each section and sub-section against the job description to determine relevance. 2. **Space Constraints**: Evaluate the space each section will occupy and prioritize sections that provide the most value based on the job description. 3. **Selection Strategy**:
   - Choose sections that directly relate to the job skills and qualifications mentioned.
   - Include high-impact sections like Education and Awards if they are particularly prestigious or relevant.
   - Limit the inclusion of broader sections like Personal Traits or Miscellaneous unless they contain standout elements that might significantly influence hiring decisions.
4. **Finalize Content**: Decide on the final arrangement of sections and sub-sections that will be included in the resume's first column, ensuring the layout remains visually appealing and easy to read.
This approach ensures that the resume is both space-efficient and tailored to highlight the applicant's qualifications most pertinent to the job opportunity. Ommitted sections should be justified based on their relevance to the job description and space constraints.

agent=Resume Content Selector2024-06-11 18:03:37: task=This task involves selecting the most relevant sections and their respective sub-sections from an applicant's comprehensive profile for inclusion in the first column of a one-page A4 resume. Given the limited space (less than half of the page width), the selection must prioritize content that aligns closely with the requirements and preferences outlined in the provided job description. 
The applicant's information provided in JSON format includes potential sections such as Education, Volunteer Work, Awards and Recognitions, References, Personal Traits and Interests, and Miscellaneous.
**Procedure**: 1. **Assess Relevance**: Compare each section and sub-section against the job description to determine relevance. 2. **Space Constraints**: Evaluate the space each section will occupy and prioritize sections that provide the most value based on the job description. 3. **Selection Strategy**:
   - Choose sections that directly relate to the job skills and qualifications mentioned.
   - Include high-impact sections like Education and Awards if they are particularly prestigious or relevant.
   - Limit the inclusion of broader sections like Personal Traits or Miscellaneous unless they contain standout elements that might significantly influence hiring decisions.
4. **Finalize Content**: Decide on the final arrangement of sections and sub-sections that will be included in the resume's first column, ensuring the layout remains visually appealing and easy to read.
This approach ensures that the resume is both space-efficient and tailored to highlight the applicant's qualifications most pertinent to the job opportunity. Ommitted sections should be justified based on their relevance to the job description and space constraints.

agent=Resume Content Selector2024-06-12 08:52:33: task=This task involves selecting the most relevant sections and their respective sub-sections from an applicant's comprehensive profile for inclusion in the first column of a one-page A4 resume. Given the limited space (less than half of the page width), the selection must prioritize content that aligns closely with the requirements and preferences outlined in the provided job description. 
The applicant's information provided in JSON format includes potential sections such as Education, Volunteer Work, Awards and Recognitions, References, Personal Traits and Interests, and Miscellaneous.
**Procedure**: 1. **Assess Relevance**: Compare each section and sub-section against the job description to determine relevance. 2. **Space Constraints**: Evaluate the space each section will occupy and prioritize sections that provide the most value based on the job description. 3. **Selection Strategy**:
   - Choose sections that directly relate to the job skills and qualifications mentioned.
   - Include high-impact sections like Education and Awards if they are particularly prestigious or relevant.
   - Limit the inclusion of broader sections like Personal Traits or Miscellaneous unless they contain standout elements that might significantly influence hiring decisions.
4. **Finalize Content**: Decide on the final arrangement of sections and sub-sections that will be included in the resume's first column, ensuring the layout remains visually appealing and easy to read.
This approach ensures that the resume is both space-efficient and tailored to highlight the applicant's qualifications most pertinent to the job opportunity. Ommitted sections should be justified based on their relevance to the job description and space constraints.

agent=Text Content Splitter2024-06-12 08:52:55: task=** Reasons to choose and not choose Other Experiences:**

Researchers examined the costs and benefits of choosing or not choosing other experiences (OEs). Overall, they found that OEs don't provide a boost to achievement or career success beyond what comes from simply investing in your preferred experience. However, there are some exceptions to this general rule. For example, OEs may be beneficial for people who are:

* **Uncertain about their career goals.** OEs can provide an opportunity to explore different career paths and gain new skills.
* **Looking to make a career change.** OEs can help you develop the skills and experience you need to transition to a new field.
* **Interested in personal growth and development.** OEs can provide an opportunity to learn new things, meet new people, and challenge yourself.

However, OEs are not always the best choice. For example, they may not be a good option for people who are:

* **Tight on time or money.** OEs can be expensive and time-consuming.
* **Already have a lot of experience in their field.** OEs may not provide much benefit for people who already have a strong foundation in their field.
* **Not sure if they want to commit to a long-term experience.** OEs typically require a significant investment of time and energy.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to choose an OE is a personal one. There is no right or wrong answer. The best choice for one person may not be the best choice for another.

**Additional considerations**

In addition to the factors discussed above, there are a few other things to consider when making a decision about whether or not to choose an OE:

* **Your personality.** Some people are more suited to OEs than others. If you are someone who is independent, adaptable, and open to new experiences, you may be more likely to benefit from an OE.
* **Your financial situation.** OEs can be expensive, so it is important to make sure that you have the financial resources to support yourself during your experience.

agent=Resume Content Selector2024-06-12 09:01:57: task=This task involves selecting the most relevant sections and their respective sub-sections from an applicant's comprehensive profile for inclusion in the first column of a one-page A4 resume. Given the limited space (less than half of the page width), the selection must prioritize content that aligns closely with the requirements and preferences outlined in the provided job description. 
The applicant's information provided in JSON format includes potential sections such as Education, Volunteer Work, Awards and Recognitions, References, Personal Traits and Interests, and Miscellaneous.
**Procedure**: 1. **Assess Relevance**: Compare each section and sub-section against the job description to determine relevance. 2. **Space Constraints**: Evaluate the space each section will occupy and prioritize sections that provide the most value based on the job description. 3. **Selection Strategy**:
   - Choose sections that directly relate to the job skills and qualifications mentioned.
   - Include high-impact sections like Education and Awards if they are particularly prestigious or relevant.
   - Limit the inclusion of broader sections like Personal Traits or Miscellaneous unless they contain standout elements that might significantly influence hiring decisions.
4. **Finalize Content**: Decide on the final arrangement of sections and sub-sections that will be included in the resume's first column, ensuring the layout remains visually appealing and easy to read.
This approach ensures that the resume is both space-efficient and tailored to highlight the applicant's qualifications most pertinent to the job opportunity. Omitted sections should be justified based on their relevance to the job description and space constraints.

Noting that secondary starter aid must be on board the
vessel during towing operations, although tugs and
vessels being towed are not required to be in
communication, and considering that communication
permits a more effective and safer towing operation
and is particularly helpful when operating in congested
waters or when conditions of visibility are poor.

Recommendation 2

Tugs and vessels being towed should whenever
practicable, be in communication with each other, and 
communication should take place particularly in
congested waters or when conditions of visibility are 
poor.

Item 20
Rationale 

In view of the fact that an outbreak of fire on a ship
may result in substantial damage to the structure and
machinery of the vessel, requiring extended repair work
to effect necessary repairs, rendering the vessel
temporarily out of service, creating thereby a potential
loss of income to the vessel owner, and recognizing
the need to ensure that the vessel leaving port is fully
prepared, ready, and able to meet its service
commitment, and having regard to the fact that the
inspection procedure stipulated in Regulation 9 of
Chapter II-2 of the 1974 SOLAS Convention is mandatory
only when a ship has been laid up or is out of service, 
and not being mandatory when a vessel is proceeding
from one port to another port, recommending that, in
order to reassess the effectiveness of the
recommendations on fire safety, a survey should be 
conducted on a selective basis so as to obtain
statistical data on the incidence of fires on ships in

agent=Resume Content Selector2024-06-12 09:04:32: task=This task involves selecting the most relevant sections and their respective sub-sections from an applicant's comprehensive profile for inclusion in the first column of a one-page A4 resume. Given the limited space (less than half of the page width), the selection must prioritize content that aligns closely with the requirements and preferences outlined in the provided job description. 
The applicant's information provided in JSON format includes potential sections such as Education, Volunteer Work, Awards and Recognitions, References, Personal Traits and Interests, and Miscellaneous.
**Procedure**: 1. **Assess Relevance**: Compare each section and sub-section against the job description to determine relevance. 2. **Space Constraints**: Evaluate the space each section will occupy and prioritize sections that provide the most value based on the job description. 3. **Selection Strategy**:
   - Choose sections that directly relate to the job skills and qualifications mentioned.
   - Include high-impact sections like Education and Awards if they are particularly prestigious or relevant.
   - Limit the inclusion of broader sections like Personal Traits or Miscellaneous unless they contain standout elements that might significantly influence hiring decisions.
4. **Finalize Content**: Decide on the final arrangement of sections and sub-sections that will be included in the resume's first column, ensuring the layout remains visually appealing and easy to read.
This approach ensures that the resume is both space-efficient and tailored to highlight the applicant's qualifications most pertinent to the job opportunity. Omitted sections should be justified based on their relevance to the job description and space constraints.

In your output, follow these guidelines:
- The first line should contain the section name "VOLUNTEER". Use the command `\section{VOLUNTEER}`. - Each volunteer entry should be structured as follows:
  - Use `\subsection{}` for organization names less than 20 characters. If any organization name exceeds 20 characters, use `\smallSubSection{}` to maintain visual consistency for all Organization name entries.
  - Present the role and the timeline of the volunteer activity in the format: `Role | Timeline`. Use `\subTitle{}` for this line to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.
  - Use the `vitemize` environment to list the responsibilities and achievements of the volunteer role.
- Conclude the volunteer section with `\sectionsep` to maintain consistent spacing between sections. - Convert special LaTeX characters to their escaped versions to prevent errors in LaTeX processing:
  - `%` to `\%`
  - `$` to `\$`
  - `&` to `\&`
  - `#` to `\#`
  - `_` to `\_`

Example: First Decide if to use `\subsection{}` or `\smallSubSection{}` based on the length of the organization name for all entries. The command should be the same for all entries.
\section{VOLUNTEER}
  \subsection{.dev Programming Club} or swap with \smallSubSection{.dev Programming Club}

2024-06-13 12:14:08: task=Convert the applicant's skills data into LaTeX format.
**Instructions**: 1. **Section Header**: Begin with the section title using \section{Skills}. 2. **Skill Categories**: 
   - Use \subTitle{} to introduce each skill category.
   - List skills in each category using \body{}, separating items with \textbullet{}, ensuring each item is concise (1-3 words).
   - Limit the number of categories to five, focusing on both exact and partial match skills relevant to the job.
3. **Formatting**:
   - Use \skillsVSpace between each category to maintain visual separation.
   - Conclude the skills section with \sectionsep to neatly transition to the next section of the resume.

The output should be crafted to fit seamlessly within a professional resume, reflecting the applicant's most pertinent skills in a concise and organized manner.
