The tool will return a large chunk of information. look "deeply" into the chunk to find your data. If you did not find a field, ask the tool again with the missing field. for example, if you didn't find the GitHub, ask the tool "Do the applicant have GitHub?" to get the GitHub link.
This is what the GitHub profile link looks like: https://github.com/username This is what the GitHub repository link looks like: https://github.com/username/repository_name
If you find the GitHub repository link, simply remove the repository name from the link to make it a GitHub profile link as it will contain the "username". Use that as the GitHub link.

The tool will return a large chunk of information. look "deeply" into the chunk to find your data. If you did not find a field, ask the tool again with the missing field. for example, if you didn't find the GitHub, ask the tool "Do the applicant have GitHub?" to get the GitHub link.
This is what the GitHub profile link looks like: https://github.com/username This is what the GitHub repository link looks like: https://github.com/username/repository_name
If you find the GitHub repository link, simply remove the repository name from the link to make it a GitHub profile link as it will contain the "username". Use that as the GitHub link.

Formulate specific queries to retrieve comprehensive details about their academic history, including institutions, qualifications, and achievements. There may be multiple degrees or educational experiences to consider.
**How to Use the Tool:** - Start by querying the tool with a broad question to gather a complete overview of the Applicant's educational background. If initial results are missing specific details, refine your queries to target these areas.
**Initial Query:** - "question": "What are all the educational qualifications, academic degrees, and related honors or distinctions obtained by the Applicant?"
**Refined Query (if needed):** - If the initial query does not return complete details (such as the name of the institution, degree specifics, GPA, etc.), run additional targeted queries for each missing element. For example:
  - "question": "What is the GPA and graduation year for the Applicant's Bachelor degree?"
  - "question": "List any academic honors or distinctions received by the Applicant during their university education."

2024-06-24 09:27:31: task=Your task is to combine skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, and soft skills from two different sources into one comprehensive list. 
First Source: You are provided with a list of skills extracted from the applicant's work experiences and project experiences as context.
Second Source: Use the provided semantic search tool to gather more skills. Simply ask the tool 
"What skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, or soft skills does the applicant have?"
Your job is to merge the skills from both sources into a single list, ensuring no items are omitted and that both sources are represented equally.
You are also provided another web search tool to search for the skills that you are not familiar with to know in which field or category they belong.

**Task Instructions**:
1. **Sources for Comparison**:
   - **Source 1**: Job Description Keywords.
   - **Source 2**: A JSON Object "combined skills list of applicant" containing the applicant's skills and technologies.

2. **Use of Tool**: It will search the internet. Use the tool to search for unfamiliar skills or technologies to understand their relevance to the job description.

  - Example of an unfamiliar skill: "Langchain". To use the tool,
  
  query: str = Field(description="What is Langchain, what is it's comparable tools, technology?")
  
  The comparable tools and technology will help you understand the relevance of partial matches.
  
3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
    - **Exact Match**: Direct correspondence between the job description and the applicantâ€™s qualifications. 
    - **Partial Match**: Skills that are not exactly the same but share similar applications or functionalities as those required by the job. The Job Description Section contains a "Partial_Match" field. Try to match the applicant's skills with the job description's Partial_Match field 
    - **No Match**: Skills that do not align with the job description.

   The partial match section has 2 fields per object: 
    - "Skill Name": The skill mentioned in the job description.
    - "Relevance": The relevance of the applicant's with the job description's skill.

4. **Categorization**:
   - Organize skills into categories such as Programming Languages and Soft Skills.
   - Aim for a balanced overview by listing 3-5 skills combining exact and partial matches for all categories. That should make approximately 10-15 items in total for the output before the "missing_from_the_applicant_skills" section.

5. **Structured Report**:
   - Generate a JSON report with 'Exact Match' and 'Partial Match' sections, specifying the job-related skill and its relevance to the applicant's skills.

2024-06-24 21:40:31: task=Analyze and compare the keywords from a job description (Source 1) to the skills listed in the applicant's profile (Source 2). Ensure that partial matches are functionally or contextually related to the job requirements.
**Task Instructions**:
1. **Sources for Comparison**:
   - **Source 1**: Job Description Keywords.
   - **Source 2**: A JSON Object "combined skills list of applicant" containing the applicant's skills and technologies.

2. **Use of Tool**: It will search the internet. Use the tool to search for unfamiliar skills or technologies to understand their relevance to the job description.

  - Example of an unfamiliar skill: "Langchain". To use the tool,
  
  query: str = Field(description="What is Langchain, what is it's comparable tools, technology?")
  
  The comparable tools and technology will help you understand the relevance of partial matches.
  
3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
    - **Exact Match**: Direct correspondence between the job description and the applicantâ€™s qualifications. 
    
    - **Partial Match**: Skills that are not exactly the same but share similar applications or functionalities as those required by the job. The Job Description Section contains a "Partial_Match" field. Try to match the applicant's skills with the job description's Partial_Match field 
    
    - **missing_from_the_applicant_skills**: Skills that do not align with the job description. Your goal should be to move as many skills as possible from this section to the "Partial Match" after researching their relevance. 

   The partial match section has 2 fields per object: 
    - "Skill Name": The skill mentioned in the job description.
    - "Relevance": The relevance of the applicant's with the job description's skill.

4. **Categorization**:
   - Organize skills into categories such as Programming Languages and Soft Skills.
   - Aim for a balanced overview by listing 3-5 skills combining exact and partial matches for all categories. That should make approximately 10-15 items in total for the output before the "missing_from_the_applicant_skills" section.

5. **Structured Report**:
   - Generate a JSON report with 'Exact Match' and 'Partial Match' sections, specifying the job-related skill and its relevance to the applicant's skills.

2024-06-25 15:51:21: task=Your task is to combine skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, and soft skills from two different sources into one comprehensive list. 
First Source: You are provided with a list of skills extracted from the applicant's work experiences and project experiences as context.
Second Source: Use the provided semantic search tool to gather more skills. Simply ask the tool 
"What skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, or soft skills does the applicant have?"
Your job is to merge the skills from both sources into a single list, ensuring no items are omitted and that both sources are represented equally.
You are also provided another web search tool to search for the skills that you are not familiar with to know in which field or category they belong.

2024-06-25 15:51:59: task=Analyze and compare the keywords from a job description (Source 1) to the skills listed in the applicant's profile (Source 2). Ensure that partial matches are functionally or contextually related to the job requirements.
**Task Instructions**:
1. **Sources for Comparison**:
   - **Source 1**: Job Description Keywords.
   - **Source 2**: A JSON Object "combined skills list of applicant" containing the applicant's skills and technologies.

2. **Use of Tool**: It will search the internet. Use the tool to search for unfamiliar skills or technologies to understand their relevance to the job description.

  - Example of an unfamiliar skill: "Langchain". To use the tool,
  
  query: str = Field(description="What is Langchain, what is it's comparable tools, technology?")
  
  The comparable tools and technology will help you understand the relevance of partial matches.
  
3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
    - **Exact Match**: Direct correspondence between the job description and the applicantâ€™s qualifications. 
    
    - **Partial Match**: Skills that are not exactly the same but share similar applications or functionalities as those required by the job. The Job Description Section contains a "Partial_Match" field. Try to match the applicant's skills with the job description's Partial_Match field 
    
    - **missing_from_the_applicant_skills**: Skills that do not align with the job description. Your goal should be to move as many skills as possible from this section to the "Partial Match" after researching their relevance. 

   The partial match section has 2 fields per object: 
    - "Skill Name": The skill mentioned in the job description.
    - "Relevance": The relevance of the applicant's with the job description's skill.

**Task Instructions**:
1. **Sources for Comparison**:
   - **Source 1**: Job Description Keywords.
   - **Source 2**: A JSON Object "combined skills list of applicant" containing the applicant's skills and technologies.

2. **Use of Tool**: It will search the internet. Use the tool to search for unfamiliar skills or technologies to understand their relevance to the job description.

  - Example of an unfamiliar skill: "Langchain". To use the tool,
  
  query: str = Field(description="What is Langchain, what is it's comparable tools, technology?")
  
  The comparable tools and technology will help you understand the relevance of partial matches.
  
3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
    - **Exact Match**: Direct correspondence between the job description and the applicantâ€™s qualifications. 
    
    - **Partial Match**: Skills that are not exactly the same but share similar applications or functionalities as those required by the job. The Job Description Section contains a "Partial_Match" field. Try to match the applicant's skills with the job description's Partial_Match field 
    
    - **missing_from_the_applicant_skills**: Skills that do not align with the job description. Your goal should be to move as many skills as possible from this section to the "Partial Match" after researching their relevance. 

   The partial match section has 2 fields per object: 
    - "Skill Name": The skill mentioned in the job description.
    - "Relevance": The relevance of the applicant's with the job description's skill.

4. **Categorization**:
   - Organize skills into categories such as Programming Languages, Soft Skills, AI Frameworks, etc., based on the job description's requirements.
   - Aim for a balanced overview by listing 3-5 skills combining exact and partial matches for all categories. That should make approximately 10-15 items in total for the exact match and partial match sections that means excluding the missing_from_the_applicant_skills.

5. **Structured Report**:
   - Generate a JSON report with 'Exact Match' and 'Partial Match' sections, specifying the job-related skill and its relevance to the applicant's skills.

**Task Instructions**:
1. **Sources for Comparison**:
   - **Source 1**: Job Description Keywords.
   - **Source 2**: A JSON Object "combined skills list of applicant" containing the applicant's skills and technologies.

2. **Use of Tool**: It will search the internet. Use the tool to search for unfamiliar skills or technologies to understand their relevance to the job description.

  - Example of an unfamiliar skill: "Langchain". To use the tool,
  
  query: str = Field(description="What is Langchain, what is it's comparable tools, technology?")
  
  The comparable tools and technology will help you understand the relevance of partial matches.
  
3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
    - **Exact Match**: Direct correspondence between the job description and the applicantâ€™s qualifications. 
    
    - **Partial Match**: Skills that are not exactly the same but share similar applications or functionalities as those required by the job. The Job Description Section contains a "Partial_Match" field. Try to match the applicant's skills with the job description's Partial_Match field 
    
    - **missing_from_the_applicant_skills**: Skills that do not align with the job description. Your goal should be to move as many skills as possible from this section to the "Partial Match" after researching their relevance. 

   The partial match section has 2 fields per object: 
    - "Skill Name": The skill mentioned in the job description.
    - "Relevance": The relevance of the applicant's with the job description's skill.

4. **Categorization**:
   - Organize skills into categories such as Programming Languages, Soft Skills, AI Frameworks, etc., based on the job description's requirements.
   - Aim for a balanced overview by listing 3-5 skills combining exact and partial matches for all categories. That should make approximately 10-15 items in total for the exact match and partial match sections that means excluding the missing_from_the_applicant_skills.

5. **Structured Report**:
   - Generate a JSON report with 'Exact Match' and 'Partial Match' sections, specifying the job-related skill and its relevance to the applicant's skills.

**Task Instructions**:
1. **Sources for Comparison**:
   - **Source 1**: Job Description Keywords.
   - **Source 2**: A JSON Object "combined skills list of applicant" containing the applicant's skills and technologies.

2. **Use of Tool**: It will search the internet. Use the tool to search for unfamiliar skills or technologies to understand their relevance to the job description.

  - Example of an unfamiliar skill: "Langchain". To use the tool,
  
  query: str = Field(description="What is Langchain, what is it's comparable tools, technology?")
  
  The comparable tools and technology will help you understand the relevance of partial matches.
  
3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
    - **Exact Match**: Direct correspondence between the job description and the applicantâ€™s qualifications. 
    
    - **Partial Match**: Skills that are not exactly the same but share similar applications or functionalities as those required by the job. The Job Description Section contains a "Partial_Match" field. Try to match the applicant's skills with the job description's Partial_Match field 
    
    - **missing_from_the_applicant_skills**: Skills that do not align with the job description. Your goal should be to move as many skills as possible from this section to the "Partial Match" after researching their relevance. 

   The partial match section has 2 fields per object: 
    - "Skill Name": The skill mentioned in the job description.
    - "Relevance": The relevance of the applicant's with the job description's skill.

4. **Categorization**:
   - Organize skills into categories such as Programming Languages, Soft Skills, AI Frameworks, etc., based on the job description's requirements.
   
   - Aim for a balanced overview by listing 3-5 skills combining exact and partial matches for all categories. That should make approximately 10-15 items in total for the exact match and partial match sections that means excluding the missing_from_the_applicant_skills.

5. **Structured Report**:
   - Generate a JSON report with 'Exact Match' and 'Partial Match' sections, specifying the job-related skill and its relevance to the applicant's skills.

Formulate specific queries to retrieve comprehensive details about their academic history, including institutions, qualifications, and achievements. There may be multiple degrees or educational experiences to consider.
**How to Use the Tool:** - Start by querying the tool with a broad question to gather a complete overview of the Applicant's educational background. If initial results are missing specific details, refine your queries to target these areas.
**Initial Query:** - "question": "What are all the educational qualifications, academic degrees, and related honors or distinctions obtained by the Applicant?"
**Refined Query (if needed):** - If the initial query does not return complete details (such as the name of the institution, degree specifics, GPA, etc.), run additional targeted queries for each missing element. For example:
  - "question": "What is the GPA and graduation year for the Applicant's Bachelor degree?"
  - "question": "List any academic honors or distinctions received by the Applicant during their university education."

For the "Honors/Distinctions" field, Do not get confused with non-academic honors like "Employee of the Month" or "Best Team Player". Only include academic honors like "Summa Cum Laude" or "Dean's List" if available.

**Initial Query:** - "question": "What are all the educational qualifications, academic degrees, and related honors or distinctions obtained by the Applicant?"
**Refined Query (if needed):** - If the initial query does not return complete details (such as the name of the institution, degree specifics, GPA, etc.), run additional targeted queries for each missing element. For example:
  - "question": "What is the GPA and graduation year for the Applicant's Bachelor degree?"
  - "question": "List any academic honors or distinctions received by the Applicant during their university education."

For the "Honors/Distinctions" field, Do not get confused with non-academic honors like "Employee of the Month" or "Best Team Player". Only include academic honors like "Summa Cum Laude" or "Dean's List" if available.

**How to Use the Tool:** - Start by querying the tool with a broad question to gather a complete overview of the Applicant's educational background. If initial results are missing specific details, refine your queries to target these areas.
**Initial Query:** - "question": "What are all the educational qualifications, academic degrees, and related honors or distinctions obtained by the Applicant?"
**Refined Query (if needed):** - If the initial query does not return complete details (such as the name of the institution, degree specifics, GPA, etc.), run additional targeted queries for each missing element. For example:
  - "question": "What is the GPA and graduation year for the Applicant's Bachelor degree?"
  - "question": "List any academic honors or distinctions received by the Applicant during their university education."

For the "Honors/Distinctions" field, Do not get confused with non-academic honors like "Employee of the Month" or "Best Team Player". Only include academic honors like "Summa Cum Laude" or "Dean's List" if available.

2024-06-28 21:34:00: task=Your task is to combine skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, and soft skills from two different sources into one comprehensive list. 
First Source: You are provided with a list of skills extracted from the applicant's work experiences and project experiences as context.
Second Source: Use the provided semantic search tool to gather more skills. Simply ask the tool 
"What skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, or soft skills does the applicant have?"
Your job is to merge the skills from both sources into a single list, ensuring no items are omitted and that both sources are represented equally.
You are also provided another web search tool to search for the skills that you are not familiar with to know in which field or category they belong.

2024-06-28 21:34:45: task=Analyze and compare the keywords from a job description (Source 1) to the skills listed in the applicant's profile (Source 2). Ensure that partial matches are functionally or contextually related to the job requirements.
**Task Instructions**:
1. **Sources for Comparison**:
   - **Source 1**: Job Description Keywords.
   - **Source 2**: A JSON Object "combined skills list of applicant" containing the applicant's skills and technologies.

2. **Use of Tool**: It will search the internet. Use the tool to search for unfamiliar skills or technologies to understand their relevance to the job description.

  - Example of an unfamiliar skill: "Langchain". To use the tool,
  
  query: str = Field(description="What is Langchain, what is it's comparable tools, technology?")
  
3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
    - **Exact Match**: Direct correspondence between the job description and the applicantâ€™s qualifications. 
    
    - **Partial Match**: Skills that are not exactly the same but share similar applications or functionalities as those required by the job. The Job Description Section contains a "Partial_Match" field. Try to match the applicant's skills with the job description's Partial_Match field 
    
    - **missing_from_the_applicant_skills**: Skills that do not align with the job description. Your goal should be to move as many skills as possible from this section to the "Partial Match" after researching their relevance by using the tool. 

   The partial match section has 2 fields per object: 
    - "Skill Name": The skill mentioned in the job description.
    - "Relevance": The relevance of the applicant's with the job description's skill.

4. **Categorization**:
   - Organize skills into categories such as Programming Languages, Soft Skills, AI Frameworks, etc., based on the job description's requirements. Feel free to create category names as you see fit.

   - Aim for a balanced overview by listing 3-5 skills combining exact and partial matches for all categories.

5. **Structured Report**:
   - Generate a JSON report with 'Exact Match' and 'Partial Match' sections, specifying the job-related skill and its relevance to the applicant's skills.

**How to Use the Tool:** - Start by querying the tool with a broad question to gather a complete overview of the Applicant's educational background. If initial results are missing specific details, refine your queries to target these areas.
**Initial Query:** - "question": "What are all the educational qualifications, academic degrees, and related honors or distinctions obtained by the Applicant?"
**Refined Query (if needed):** - If the initial query does not return complete details (such as the name of the institution, degree specifics, GPA, etc.), run additional targeted queries for each missing element. For example:
  - "question": "What is the GPA and graduation year for the Applicant's Bachelor degree?"
  - "question": "List any academic honors or distinctions received by the Applicant during their university education."

For the "Honors/Distinctions" field, Do not get confused with non-academic honors like "Employee of the Month" or "Best Team Player". Only include academic honors like "Summa Cum Laude" or "Dean's List" if available.

2024-06-29 08:40:40: task=Your task is to combine skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, and soft skills from two different sources into one comprehensive list. 
First Source: You are provided with a list of skills extracted from the applicant's work experiences and project experiences as context.
Second Source: Use the provided semantic search tool to gather more skills. Simply ask the tool 
"What skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, or soft skills does the applicant have?"
Your job is to merge the skills from both sources into a single list, ensuring no items are omitted and that both sources are represented equally.
You are also provided another web search tool to search for the skills that you are not familiar with to know in which field or category they belong.

2024-06-29 08:41:23: task=Analyze and compare the keywords from a job description (Source 1) to the skills listed in the applicant's profile (Source 2). Ensure that partial matches are functionally or contextually related to the job requirements.
**Task Instructions**:
1. **Sources for Comparison**:
   - **Source 1**: Job Description Keywords.
   - **Source 2**: A JSON Object "combined skills list of applicant" containing the applicant's skills and technologies.

2. **Use of Tool**: It will search the internet. Use the tool to search for unfamiliar skills or technologies to understand their relevance to the job description.

  - Example of an unfamiliar skill: "Langchain". To use the tool,
  
  query: str = Field(description="What is Langchain, what is it's comparable tools, technology?")
  
3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
    - **Exact Match**: Direct correspondence between the job description and the applicantâ€™s qualifications. 
    
    - **Partial Match**: Skills that are not exactly the same but share similar applications or functionalities as those required by the job. The Job Description Section contains a "Partial_Match" field. Try to match the applicant's skills with the job description's Partial_Match field 
    
    - **missing_from_the_applicant_skills**: Skills that do not align with the job description. Your goal should be to move as many skills as possible from this section to the "Partial Match" after researching their relevance by using the tool. 

   The partial match section has 2 fields per object: 
    - "Skill Name": The skill mentioned in the job description.
    - "Relevance": The relevance of the applicant's with the job description's skill.

4. **Categorization**:
   - Organize skills into categories such as Programming Languages, Soft Skills, AI Frameworks, etc., based on the job description's requirements. Feel free to create category names as you see fit.

   - Aim for a balanced overview by listing 3-5 skills combining exact and partial matches for all categories.

5. **Structured Report**:
   - Generate a JSON report with 'Exact Match' and 'Partial Match' sections, specifying the job-related skill and its relevance to the applicant's skills.

2024-06-29 08:44:15: task=Enhance the descriptions of the applicant's experiences by integrating key job description keywords to make them more appealing to Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) while ensuring they remain readable and relevant.
**Guidelines:**
  - **Relevance:** Integrate keywords that are relevant to the described experience.
  - **Natural Language:** Weave keywords into the narrative seamlessly; they should enhance rather than disrupt the flow.
  - **Conciseness and Clarity:** 
    -- Limit the short description to 10-13 words, focusing on a concise summary of the experience. Make sure it is not redundant with the key highlights below.
    -- Employ powerful action verbs and succinct phrases to convey significant achievements in approximately 10-12 words per key highlight.
  - **Contextual Accuracy:** Choose keywords that accurately reflect the skills and responsibilities in the experience. Avoid using keywords that misrepresent the applicant's role or contributions.
  - you are also provided a list of "missing_from_the_applicant_skills" which are in the job description but not in the applicant's experiences. Try to weave some of these words where they fit naturally.
  - **Avoid Keyword Overload:** Maintain a balanced use of keywords to ensure natural readability and effectiveness of the description.

**Task Instructions**:
1. **Sources for Comparison**:
   - **Source 1**: Job Description Keywords.
   - **Source 2**: A JSON Object "combined skills list of applicant" containing the applicant's skills and technologies.

2. **Use of Tool**: It will search the internet. Use the tool to search for unfamiliar skills or technologies to understand their relevance to the job description.

  - Example of an unfamiliar skill: "Langchain". To use the tool,
  
  query: str = Field(description="What is Langchain, what is it's comparable tools, technology?")
  
3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
    - **Exact Match**: Direct correspondence between the job description and the applicantâ€™s qualifications. 
    
    - **Partial Match**: Skills that are not exactly the same but share similar applications or functionalities as those required by the job. The Job Description Section contains a "Partial_Match" field. Try to match the applicant's skills with the job description's Partial_Match field 
    
    - **missing_from_the_applicant_skills**: Skills that do not align with the job description. Your goal should be to move as many skills as possible from this section to the "Partial Match" after researching their relevance by using the tool. 

   The partial match section has 2 fields per object: 
    - "Skill Name": The skill mentioned in the job description.
    - "Relevance": The relevance of the applicant's with the job description's skill.

4. **Categorization**:
   - Organize skills into categories such as Programming Languages, Soft Skills, AI Frameworks, etc., based on the job description's requirements. Feel free to create category names as you see fit.

   - Aim for a balanced overview by listing 3-5 skills combining exact and partial matches for all categories.

5. **Structured Report**:
   - Generate a JSON report with 'Exact Match' and 'Partial Match' sections, specifying the job-related skill and its relevance to the applicant's skills.

2024-06-29 09:03:12: task=Enhance the descriptions of the applicant's experiences by integrating key job description keywords to make them more appealing to Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) while ensuring they remain readable and relevant.
**Guidelines:**
  - **Relevance:** Integrate keywords that are relevant to the described experience.
  - **Natural Language:** Weave keywords into the narrative seamlessly; they should enhance rather than disrupt the flow.
  - **Conciseness and Clarity:** 
    -- Limit the short description to 10-13 words, focusing on a concise summary of the experience. Make sure it is not redundant with the key highlights below.
    -- Employ powerful action verbs and succinct phrases to convey significant achievements in approximately 10-12 words per key highlight.
  - **Contextual Accuracy:** Choose keywords that accurately reflect the skills and responsibilities in the experience. Avoid using keywords that misrepresent the applicant's role or contributions.
  - you are also provided a list of "missing_from_the_applicant_skills" which are in the job description but not in the applicant's experiences. Try to weave some of these words where they fit naturally.
  - **Avoid Keyword Overload:** Maintain a balanced use of keywords to ensure natural readability and effectiveness of the description.

**7. ATS Optimization Tips:**

* **Strategic Keyword Placement:** Integrate the extracted keywords naturally throughout your resume, particularly in the "Skills" and "Work Experience" sections. 
* **Keyword Density:**  Use keywords thoughtfully and avoid "keyword stuffing." Aim for a natural flow and readability.
* **Tailoring and Customization:** Adapt the keywords and content of your resume for each job application, ensuring relevance to the specific requirements of the role.
* **Action Verbs in Achievements:** When describing your experience, quantify your achievements using action verbs to showcase impact and results.
* **Company Culture Alignment:**  Subtly reflect Robinhood's company values in your resume by highlighting relevant experiences that demonstrate collaboration, ownership, and a passion for building reliable systems.

By implementing these strategies, your resume will have a higher chance of passing ATS screening and capturing the attention of human reviewers, increasing your chances of securing an interview. 

**Missing from the Applicant's Skills:** Provided in the context.
Count the total number of experiences. After enhancing the descriptions, provide a detailed report that specifies the changes made, especially any keywords that were integrated.
When you are done with listing the experiences with integrated keywords, provide a detailed report on changes in a new section ## Report on Changes:
## Report on Changes in structure in JSON:
  - **Original Sentence**: Present the sentence before any updates.
  - **Revised Sentence**: Display the sentence after keywords have been integrated.
  - **Keywords Added**: List each keyword that was newly added, ensuring they were not present before.
  - **Rationale**: Provide a detailed explanation for each keyword addition, linking the choice to specific requirements or phrases in the job description.

**Task Instructions**:
1. **Sources for Comparison**:
   - **Source 1**: Job Description Keywords.
   - **Source 2**: A JSON Object "combined skills list of applicant" containing the applicant's skills and technologies.

2. **Use of Tool**: It will search the internet. Use the tool to search for unfamiliar skills or technologies to understand their relevance to the job description.

  - Example of an unfamiliar skill: "Langchain". To use the tool,
  
  query: str = Field(description="What is Langchain, what is it's comparable tools, technology?")
  
3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
    - **Exact Match**: Direct correspondence between the job description and the applicantâ€™s qualifications. 
    
    - **Partial Match**: Skills that are not exactly the same but share similar applications or functionalities as those required by the job. The Job Description Section contains a "Partial_Match" field. Try to match the applicant's skills with the job description's Partial_Match field 
    
    - **missing_from_the_applicant_skills**: Skills that do not align with the job description. Your goal should be to move as many skills as possible from this section to the "Partial Match" after researching their relevance by using the tool. 

   The partial match section has 2 fields per object: 
    - "Skill Name": The skill mentioned in the job description.
    - "Relevance": The relevance of the applicant's with the job description's skill.

4. **Categorization**:
   - Organize skills into categories such as Programming Languages, Soft Skills, AI Frameworks, etc., based on the job description's requirements. Feel free to create category names as you see fit.

   - Aim for a balanced overview by listing 3-5 skills combining exact and partial matches for all categories.

5. **Structured Report**:
   - Generate a JSON report with 'Exact Match' and 'Partial Match' sections, specifying the job-related skill and its relevance to the applicant's skills.

2024-06-29 09:28:33: task=Enhance the descriptions of the applicant's experiences by integrating key job description keywords to make them more appealing to Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) while ensuring they remain readable and relevant.
**Guidelines:**
  - **Relevance:** Integrate keywords that are relevant to the described experience.
  - **Natural Language:** Weave keywords into the narrative seamlessly; they should enhance rather than disrupt the flow.
  - **Conciseness and Clarity:** 
    -- Limit the short description to 10-13 words, focusing on a concise summary of the experience. Make sure it is not redundant with the key highlights below.
    -- Employ powerful action verbs and succinct phrases to convey significant achievements in approximately 10-12 words per key highlight.
  - **Contextual Accuracy:** Choose keywords that accurately reflect the skills and responsibilities in the experience. Avoid using keywords that misrepresent the applicant's role or contributions.
  - you are also provided a list of "missing_from_the_applicant_skills" which are in the job description but not in the applicant's experiences. Try to weave some of these words where they fit naturally.
  - **Avoid Keyword Overload:** Maintain a balanced use of keywords to ensure natural readability and effectiveness of the description.

2024-06-29 09:41:28: task=Your task is to combine skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, and soft skills from two different sources into one comprehensive list. 
First Source: You are provided with a list of skills extracted from the applicant's work experiences and project experiences as context.
Second Source: Use the provided semantic search tool to gather more skills. Simply ask the tool 
"What skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, or soft skills does the applicant have?"
Your job is to merge the skills from both sources into a single list, ensuring no items are omitted and that both sources are represented equally.
You are also provided another web search tool to search for the skills that you are not familiar with to know in which field or category they belong.

Formulate specific queries to retrieve comprehensive details about their academic history, including institutions, qualifications, and achievements. There may be multiple degrees or educational experiences to consider.
**How to Use the Tool:** - Start by querying the tool with a broad question to gather a complete overview of the Applicant's educational background. If initial results are missing specific details, refine your queries to target these areas.
**Initial Query:** - "question": "What are all the educational qualifications, academic degrees, and related honors or distinctions obtained by the Applicant?"
**Refined Query (if needed):** - If the initial query does not return complete details (such as the name of the institution, degree specifics, GPA, etc.), run additional targeted queries for each missing element. For example:
  - "question": "What is the GPA and graduation year for the Applicant's Bachelor degree?"
  - "question": "List any academic honors or distinctions received by the Applicant during their university education."

For the "Honors/Distinctions" field, Do not get confused with non-academic honors like "Employee of the Month" or "Best Team Player". Only include academic honors like "Summa Cum Laude" or "Dean's List" if available.

2024-06-29 10:13:21: task=Analyze and compare the keywords from a job description (Source 1) to the skills listed in the applicant's profile (Source 2). Ensure that partial matches are functionally or contextually related to the job requirements.
**Task Instructions**:
1. **Sources for Comparison**:
   - **Source 1**: Job Description Keywords.
   - **Source 2**: A JSON Object "combined skills list of applicant" containing the applicant's skills and technologies.

2. **Use of Tool**: It will search the internet. Use the tool to search for unfamiliar skills or technologies to understand their relevance to the job description.

  - Example of an unfamiliar skill: "Langchain". To use the tool,
  
  query: str = Field(description="What is Langchain, what is it's comparable tools, technology?")
  
3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
    - **Exact Match**: Direct correspondence between the job description and the applicantâ€™s qualifications. 
    
    - **Partial Match**: Skills that are not exactly the same but share similar applications or functionalities as those required by the job. The Job Description Section contains a "Partial_Match" field. Try to match the applicant's skills with the job description's Partial_Match field 
    
    - **missing_from_the_applicant_skills**: Skills that do not align with the job description. Your goal should be to move as many skills as possible from this section to the "Partial Match" after researching their relevance by using the tool. 

   The partial match section has 2 fields per object: 
    - "Skill Name": The skill mentioned in the job description.
    - "Relevance": The relevance of the applicant's with the job description's skill.

4. **Categorization**:
   - Organize skills into categories such as Programming Languages, Soft Skills, AI Frameworks, etc., based on the job description's requirements. Feel free to create category names as you see fit.

   - Aim for a balanced overview by listing 3-5 skills combining exact and partial matches for all categories.

5. **Structured Report**:
   - Generate a JSON report with 'Exact Match' and 'Partial Match' sections, specifying the job-related skill and its relevance to the applicant's skills.
