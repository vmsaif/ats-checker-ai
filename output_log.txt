The tool will return a large chunk of information. look "deeply" into the chunk to find your data. If you did not find a field, ask the tool again with the missing field. for example, if you didn't find the GitHub, ask the tool "Do the applicant have GitHub?" to get the GitHub link.
This is what the GitHub profile link looks like: https://github.com/username This is what the GitHub repository link looks like: https://github.com/username/repository_name
If you find the GitHub repository link, simply remove the repository name from the link to make it a GitHub profile link as it will contain the "username". Use that as the GitHub link.

The tool will return a large chunk of information. look "deeply" into the chunk to find your data. If you did not find a field, ask the tool again with the missing field. for example, if you didn't find the GitHub, ask the tool "Do the applicant have GitHub?" to get the GitHub link.
This is what the GitHub profile link looks like: https://github.com/username This is what the GitHub repository link looks like: https://github.com/username/repository_name
If you find the GitHub repository link, simply remove the repository name from the link to make it a GitHub profile link as it will contain the "username". Use that as the GitHub link.

Formulate specific queries to retrieve comprehensive details about their academic history, including institutions, qualifications, and achievements. There may be multiple degrees or educational experiences to consider.
**How to Use the Tool:** - Start by querying the tool with a broad question to gather a complete overview of the Applicant's educational background. If initial results are missing specific details, refine your queries to target these areas.
**Initial Query:** - "question": "What are all the educational qualifications, academic degrees, and related honors or distinctions obtained by the Applicant?"
**Refined Query (if needed):** - If the initial query does not return complete details (such as the name of the institution, degree specifics, GPA, etc.), run additional targeted queries for each missing element. For example:
  - "question": "What is the GPA and graduation year for the Applicant's Bachelor degree?"
  - "question": "List any academic honors or distinctions received by the Applicant during their university education."
