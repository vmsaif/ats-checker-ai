The tool will return a large chunk of information. look "deeply" into the chunk to find your data. If you did not find a field, ask the tool again with the missing field. for example, if you didn't find the GitHub, ask the tool "Do the applicant have GitHub?" to get the GitHub link.
This is what the GitHub profile link looks like: https://github.com/username This is what the GitHub repository link looks like: https://github.com/username/repository_name
If you find the GitHub repository link, simply remove the repository name from the link to make it a GitHub profile link as it will contain the "username". Use that as the GitHub link.

The tool will return a large chunk of information. look "deeply" into the chunk to find your data. If you did not find a field, ask the tool again with the missing field. for example, if you didn't find the GitHub, ask the tool "Do the applicant have GitHub?" to get the GitHub link.
This is what the GitHub profile link looks like: https://github.com/username This is what the GitHub repository link looks like: https://github.com/username/repository_name
If you find the GitHub repository link, simply remove the repository name from the link to make it a GitHub profile link as it will contain the "username". Use that as the GitHub link.

Formulate specific queries to retrieve comprehensive details about their academic history, including institutions, qualifications, and achievements. There may be multiple degrees or educational experiences to consider.
**How to Use the Tool:** - Start by querying the tool with a broad question to gather a complete overview of the Applicant's educational background. If initial results are missing specific details, refine your queries to target these areas.
**Initial Query:** - "question": "What are all the educational qualifications, academic degrees, and related honors or distinctions obtained by the Applicant?"
**Refined Query (if needed):** - If the initial query does not return complete details (such as the name of the institution, degree specifics, GPA, etc.), run additional targeted queries for each missing element. For example:
  - "question": "What is the GPA and graduation year for the Applicant's Bachelor degree?"
  - "question": "List any academic honors or distinctions received by the Applicant during their university education."

2024-06-24 09:27:31: task=Your task is to combine skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, and soft skills from two different sources into one comprehensive list. 
First Source: You are provided with a list of skills extracted from the applicant's work experiences and project experiences as context.
Second Source: Use the provided semantic search tool to gather more skills. Simply ask the tool 
"What skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, or soft skills does the applicant have?"
Your job is to merge the skills from both sources into a single list, ensuring no items are omitted and that both sources are represented equally.
You are also provided another web search tool to search for the skills that you are not familiar with to know in which field or category they belong.

**Task Instructions**:
1. **Sources for Comparison**:
   - **Source 1**: Job Description Keywords.
   - **Source 2**: A JSON Object "combined skills list of applicant" containing the applicant's skills and technologies.

2. **Use of Tool**: It will search the internet. Use the tool to search for unfamiliar skills or technologies to understand their relevance to the job description.

  - Example of an unfamiliar skill: "Langchain". To use the tool,
  
  query: str = Field(description="What is Langchain, what is it's comparable tools, technology?")
  
  The comparable tools and technology will help you understand the relevance of partial matches.
  
3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
    - **Exact Match**: Direct correspondence between the job description and the applicantâ€™s qualifications. 
    - **Partial Match**: Skills that are not exactly the same but share similar applications or functionalities as those required by the job. The Job Description Section contains a "Partial_Match" field. Try to match the applicant's skills with the job description's Partial_Match field 
    - **No Match**: Skills that do not align with the job description.

   The partial match section has 2 fields per object: 
    - "Skill Name": The skill mentioned in the job description.
    - "Relevance": The relevance of the applicant's with the job description's skill.

4. **Categorization**:
   - Organize skills into categories such as Programming Languages and Soft Skills.
   - Aim for a balanced overview by listing 3-5 skills combining exact and partial matches for all categories. That should make approximately 10-15 items in total for the output before the "missing_from_the_applicant_skills" section.

5. **Structured Report**:
   - Generate a JSON report with 'Exact Match' and 'Partial Match' sections, specifying the job-related skill and its relevance to the applicant's skills.

2024-06-24 21:40:31: task=Analyze and compare the keywords from a job description (Source 1) to the skills listed in the applicant's profile (Source 2). Ensure that partial matches are functionally or contextually related to the job requirements.
**Task Instructions**:
1. **Sources for Comparison**:
   - **Source 1**: Job Description Keywords.
   - **Source 2**: A JSON Object "combined skills list of applicant" containing the applicant's skills and technologies.

2. **Use of Tool**: It will search the internet. Use the tool to search for unfamiliar skills or technologies to understand their relevance to the job description.

  - Example of an unfamiliar skill: "Langchain". To use the tool,
  
  query: str = Field(description="What is Langchain, what is it's comparable tools, technology?")
  
  The comparable tools and technology will help you understand the relevance of partial matches.
  
3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
    - **Exact Match**: Direct correspondence between the job description and the applicantâ€™s qualifications. 
    
    - **Partial Match**: Skills that are not exactly the same but share similar applications or functionalities as those required by the job. The Job Description Section contains a "Partial_Match" field. Try to match the applicant's skills with the job description's Partial_Match field 
    
    - **missing_from_the_applicant_skills**: Skills that do not align with the job description. Your goal should be to move as many skills as possible from this section to the "Partial Match" after researching their relevance. 

   The partial match section has 2 fields per object: 
    - "Skill Name": The skill mentioned in the job description.
    - "Relevance": The relevance of the applicant's with the job description's skill.

4. **Categorization**:
   - Organize skills into categories such as Programming Languages and Soft Skills.
   - Aim for a balanced overview by listing 3-5 skills combining exact and partial matches for all categories. That should make approximately 10-15 items in total for the output before the "missing_from_the_applicant_skills" section.

5. **Structured Report**:
   - Generate a JSON report with 'Exact Match' and 'Partial Match' sections, specifying the job-related skill and its relevance to the applicant's skills.

2024-06-25 15:51:21: task=Your task is to combine skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, and soft skills from two different sources into one comprehensive list. 
First Source: You are provided with a list of skills extracted from the applicant's work experiences and project experiences as context.
Second Source: Use the provided semantic search tool to gather more skills. Simply ask the tool 
"What skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, or soft skills does the applicant have?"
Your job is to merge the skills from both sources into a single list, ensuring no items are omitted and that both sources are represented equally.
You are also provided another web search tool to search for the skills that you are not familiar with to know in which field or category they belong.

2024-06-25 15:51:59: task=Analyze and compare the keywords from a job description (Source 1) to the skills listed in the applicant's profile (Source 2). Ensure that partial matches are functionally or contextually related to the job requirements.
**Task Instructions**:
1. **Sources for Comparison**:
   - **Source 1**: Job Description Keywords.
   - **Source 2**: A JSON Object "combined skills list of applicant" containing the applicant's skills and technologies.

2. **Use of Tool**: It will search the internet. Use the tool to search for unfamiliar skills or technologies to understand their relevance to the job description.

  - Example of an unfamiliar skill: "Langchain". To use the tool,
  
  query: str = Field(description="What is Langchain, what is it's comparable tools, technology?")
  
  The comparable tools and technology will help you understand the relevance of partial matches.
  
3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
    - **Exact Match**: Direct correspondence between the job description and the applicantâ€™s qualifications. 
    
    - **Partial Match**: Skills that are not exactly the same but share similar applications or functionalities as those required by the job. The Job Description Section contains a "Partial_Match" field. Try to match the applicant's skills with the job description's Partial_Match field 
    
    - **missing_from_the_applicant_skills**: Skills that do not align with the job description. Your goal should be to move as many skills as possible from this section to the "Partial Match" after researching their relevance. 

   The partial match section has 2 fields per object: 
    - "Skill Name": The skill mentioned in the job description.
    - "Relevance": The relevance of the applicant's with the job description's skill.
