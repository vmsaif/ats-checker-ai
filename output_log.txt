2024-06-09 09:54:35: task=Your task is to combine skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, and soft skills from two different sources into one comprehensive list. 
First Source: You are provided with a list of skills extracted from the applicant's work experiences and project experiences as context.
Second Source: Use the provided semantic search tool to gather more skills. Simply ask the tool 
"What skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, or soft skills does the applicant have?"
Your job is to merge the skills from both sources into a single list, ensuring no items are omitted and that both sources are represented equally.
You are also provided another web search tool to search for the skills that you are not familiar with to know in which field or category they belong.

**Initial Query:** - "question": "What are all the educational qualifications, academic degrees, and related honors or distinctions obtained by the Applicant?"
**Refined Query (if needed):** - If the initial query does not return complete details (such as the name of the institution, degree specifics, GPA, etc.), run additional targeted queries for each missing element. For example:
  - "question": "What is the GPA and graduation year for the Applicant's Bachelor degree?"
  - "question": "List any academic honors or distinctions received by the Applicant during their university education."

The tool will return a large chunk of information. look "deeply" into the chunk to find your data. If you did not find a field, ask the tool again with the missing field. for example, if you didn't find the GitHub, ask the tool "Do the applicant have GitHub?" to get the GitHub link.
This is what the GitHub profile link looks like: https://github.com/username This is what the GitHub repository link looks like: https://github.com/username/repository_name
If you find the GitHub repository link, simply remove the repository name from the link to make it a GitHub profile link as it will contain the "username". Use that as the GitHub link.

How you should use the tool: argument: "question": "Give me Personal Details about the applicant"
The tool will return a large chunk of information. look "deeply" into the chunk to find your data. If you did not find a field, ask the tool again with the missing field. for example, if you didn't find the GitHub, ask the tool "Do the applicant have GitHub?" to get the GitHub link.
This is what the GitHub profile link looks like: https://github.com/username This is what the GitHub repository link looks like: https://github.com/username/repository_name
If you find the GitHub repository link, simply remove the repository name from the link to make it a GitHub profile link as it will contain the "username". Use that as the GitHub link.

Formulate specific queries to retrieve comprehensive details about their academic history, including institutions, qualifications, and achievements. There may be multiple degrees or educational experiences to consider.
**How to Use the Tool:** - Start by querying the tool with a broad question to gather a complete overview of the Applicant's educational background. If initial results are missing specific details, refine your queries to target these areas.
**Initial Query:** - "question": "What are all the educational qualifications, academic degrees, and related honors or distinctions obtained by the Applicant?"
**Refined Query (if needed):** - If the initial query does not return complete details (such as the name of the institution, degree specifics, GPA, etc.), run additional targeted queries for each missing element. For example:
  - "question": "What is the GPA and graduation year for the Applicant's Bachelor degree?"
  - "question": "List any academic honors or distinctions received by the Applicant during their university education."
