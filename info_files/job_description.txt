About Radical AI:

Radical AI Principles
We recognize that power is distributed unevenly, and People of Color, Black, Indigenous, Women, Queer, Trans, Gender Non-Conforming, Poor, Dis-abled, and other communities are pushed to the margins. We commit to resisting these interlocking systems of oppression, including Racism, Coloniality, Casteism, Heteropatriarchy, Capitalism, and Ableism. We commit to striving toward collective liberation.1
We center radical work by communities at the margins.
We recognize that all technologies rearrange power.
We are critical of how AI shifts power. In particular, we recognize AI is frequently extractive, exploitative, surveilling, controlling, prescriptive, and reductionist. We recognize AI frequently prevents consent, deliberation, investigation, intervention, resistance, and agency.
We recognize the privilege of being adjacent to institutions creating technologies. We use this privilege to step up to expose oppressive technologies and to center those harmed, and to step back, ceding power, listening, and co-conspiring when those voices speak.
We value dreaming up and building human/AI systems that put power in the hands of the people. We recognize this is vulnerable and important work.
We recognize that reforming harmful AI can reduce harm to some while legitimizing (“ethics-washing”) systems still harming others2. Only by understanding the root of the harm and centering those most impacted can we make these complex tactical decisions, deciding when to minimize harm done by AI and when to call for its abolition3. We recognize that no one has a ‘view from nowhere’4. We practice reflexivity, naming who we are, how who we are influences what we do, and whose perspectives are missing.

At the Radical AI for Social Good Lab, we’re dedicated to leveraging AI responsibly. Our core mission is to democratize AI technology, making it a catalyst for education, social mobility, and equitable progress across global communities.
